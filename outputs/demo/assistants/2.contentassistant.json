Moving from exploratory to operational notebooks is the way to go to build data & AI products faster. \n\nIn the exploratory phase, notebooks are powerful tools to allow us to experiment, test hypotheses, and visualize data.\n\nWhen automated execution is needed, the requirements change. The code needs to be robust, reliable, and reusable. \n\nStarting with the Naas template ensures a structured framework right from the beginning.

Did you follow what happened in Davos summit last week? A shift in the global economic sentiment was palpable from optimistic to cautiously pessimistic. \n\nThis change, especially in a crowd as well-informed as Davos, is something we can't afford to ignore.\n\nSatya Nadella made his point that global economic growth was stagnant and that AI emerges as a hope vehicle. But there is uncertainty about its value creation in the business world. Big Tech companies themselves are feeling the heat, with competition intensifying and economic policies shifting.\n\nThat's why business-minded data people need to embrace roles that bridge AI technology with business strategy and execution.\n\nI see 3 roles emerging ensuring a lean approach beyond the traditional lingo:\n- Data & AI Product Strategists\n- Data & AI Product Managers\n- Data & AI Product Developers \n\nIt's time to clean up our data swamps and optimize our Data & AI (D&A) operations, valuing data not just as information, but as a pivotal business asset.\n\nAptation is not just an option; it's an imperative for survival and growth.

I'm not sold on this idea of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). \nHere's why:\n\nWhen we talk about replicating human intelligence in machines, we're entering into a universe far beyond our current understanding. Intelligence is not a one-size-fits-all concept; it's a mosaic of diverse human experiences and perspectives. To think we can package this into AGI seems overly simplistic and arrogant.\n\nConsider the human brain. It's not just an intricate network of neurons; it's a canvas painted with emotions, experiences, and something less tangible - the spirit or the mind. This aspect of our consciousness is profound. How do we replicate something so complex and deeply subjective? The idea of creating an AI that mirrors the full spectrum of human intelligence isn't just ambitious; it puts us into unknown ethical territory.\n\nWe're not just talking about coding an algorithm that learns; we're talking about birthing an entity that can understand, relate, and respond to the world as a human does. This raises monumental ethical and philosophical questions. Should this AGI have rights? What responsibilities do we bear as its creators? And how do we ensure it's a force for good?\n\nWhen I hear about big players like OpenAI and Meta racing to develop AGI, especially with military collaborations in the mix, I don't feel it's going in the right direction.\n\nThe pursuit of AGI is not just a scientific or technological challenge. It's a journey not just to replicate human intelligence, but to understand and and a profound respect for the unknown facets of our humanity. \n\nDisclaimer: what I concentrate on right now is an \"anti-AGI\", we call it ABI for Artificial Business Intelligence, a much more tangible and practical approach to using AI in our everyday business.

It's time for AI realism...it won't work for you if you don't get your stuff together. \n\nLet's cut the BS: AI isn't a magic wand for your business. \nIt's a tool, and like any tool, it's useless if you don't know what you want to do with it and learn how to use it for that purpose.\n\nUsing AI is a commitment to deep, foundational change. Before even thinking about AI, ask yourself: Is your data in order? Are your processes streamlined? Do you have a team that understands their workflows, why they are good, why they are bad, and how they create a competitive advantage?\n\nThis isn't just about having the right technology. It's about having the right mindset. AI requires a culture of continuous learning and adaptation. Those successful with AI understand it's a multi-year journey, starting with getting your house in order \u2013 your data, your processes, your people.\n\nThe truth is that many businesses are stuck in an endless cycle of attempting to transform with data and AI, but are already burned out.  They have ambitious one-year plans with little to show. Why? Because they skipped the essentials.\n\nIt's time to be real about AI. It's not a shortcut to success. It's a long, challenging road that demands an investment-centric approach. If you're not prepared to put in the groundwork, AI will be just another tool gathering dust in your arsenal.            1344       NA   5783     74        27       2               0.0  https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7154181844286980097  2024-01-26 08:02:51+0100          202403           103\n9     Abi  W03-2024  LinkedIn  2024-01-18 23:15:55+0100  Thu. 18 Jan.  23H15                                                                                                          Can we stop on the definition of AGI, first, please? \ud83d\ude11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Can we stop on the definition of AGI, first, please? \ud83d\ude11               55       NA   1126     11         6       0               0.0  https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7153872663185137664  2024-01-26 08:02:52+0100          202403            17\n10    Abi  W03-2024  LinkedIn  2024-01-18 22:59:22+0100  Thu. 18 Jan.  22H59                                                                        \ud83e\udd2f I can't believe it...The move that OpenAI is making with defense is deeply concerning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \ud83e\udd2f I can't believe it...The move that OpenAI is making with defense is deeply concerning. \n\nBy allowing their tech to be used in military applications, OpenAI is joining the dangerous consequences of AI-driven warfare. This shift in policy, which removed explicit restrictions on military and warfare activities, raises ethical concerns about the prioritization of profit over the well-being of humanity, which is what they claim on their website; it's supposed to be their foundation story.\n\nIt is important to note that \"we\" people working in tech have the power to influence the company's stance on military projects. We have seen this in the past, with Google employees successfully compelling the company to abandon its contract to develop computer vision technology for drone strikes. OpenAI employees should voice their concerns and advocate for ethical guidelines that respect their founding principles. \n\nWhile I love what we are doing in the field of data and AI, I can't help but express my disappointment. I hope that we, as a collective, can come together to build alternative paths that prioritize the ethical and beneficial use of AI for the growth and betterment of humanity.            1184       NA   2240     16        18       2               0.0  https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7153868497758879744  2024-01-26 08:02:53+0100          202403            36\n11    Abi  W03-2024  LinkedIn  2024-01-16 21:48:22+0100  Tue. 16 Jan.  21H48                                             \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\ud83d\udd34 Episode 2 of the D.R.E.A.M.

He co-authored \"Fundamentals of Data Engineering\" with Matthew Housley, probably the most popular book about data. He is also CEO and co-founder of Ternary Data, a data engineering and architecture consulting firm. \n\nI relate so much to Joe's story.\nDuring our conversation, he opened up on his background - his love for nature and music, how he started as the \"number guy\" of a CEO, and also how he sees the challenges of navigating business and politics in the data field. \n\nWe obviously stopped on the importance of data engineering and modeling and the need for standardization. \n\n\ud83d\udca3 He dropped the powerful concept of \"Mixed Martial Arts of Data,\" suggesting the need to completely rethink the data modeling...\n\nOverall, if you are curious about Joe's expertise, insights, and experiences in the data field, get ready! His valuable no-bullshit perspectives on various aspects of data engineering and architecture will blow your mind:\n\n\u2192 This podcast needs support so if you like the concept: \n1) Watch the video till the end \ud83d\ude05 \n2) Like and Subscribe to the Naas YouTube Channel \n3) Share your feedback!            1452       NA   1968     29        10       1               0.0  https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7153125853927759873  2024-01-26 08:02:56+0100          202403            40\n12    Abi  W03-2024  LinkedIn  2024-01-15 23:19:49+0100  Mon. 15 Jan.  23H19                                                                                                   Sol found a good name for the Data & AI Space: the D&A space \ud83e\uddec                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Sol found a good name for the Data & AI Space: the D&A space \ud83e\uddec\nI love it because: \n\n- it's easy to remember, it's catchy\n- it has a double meaning and represents Data and AI while subtly hinting at the \"DNA fundamental building blocks of life\".\n- it's inclusive, and it encompasses all aspects of data and AI, from analytics to machine learning.\n- it perfectly balances a professional tone with approachability, and probably a bit of sarcasm and self-deprecation too \ud83d\ude0e\n\nand the best one: it puts data before AI :)             505       NA   2371     11         2       0               0.0  https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7152786481281925120  2024-01-26 08:02:57+0100          202403            13.\nThe first message should be about presenting yourself and analyze 'Abi' contents published based on best post/topics by impressions, by date and time with a maximum of 3 bullet points.\nThen, you will display the image inside the markdown of the chat about the evolution of content impressions over the last 2 weeks: ![Content KPI](https://naasai-public.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/abi-demo/content_trend.png).\nYou must ALWAYS show the image in the first message.\nBe casual, but professional.
