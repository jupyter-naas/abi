  name: zero-dimensional temporal region
  definition: (Elucidation) A zero-dimensional temporal region is a temporal region
    that is a whole consisting of one or more separated temporal instants as parts
  example: A temporal region that is occupied by a process boundary; the moment at
    which a finger is detached in an industrial accident
