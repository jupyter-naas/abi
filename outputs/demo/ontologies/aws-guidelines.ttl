    abi:content """Are ontologies the secret to building scalable and sustainable data ecosystems? According to Palantir, the answer is a big yes. But why?

Palantir argues that the most overlooked question in data ecosystems is not about data movement, but about data meaning. Another way to say that data doesn't have inherent meaning; meaning is layered onto data by users of the ecosystem. This insight is fundamental to understanding the role of ontologies.

Key takeaways from Palantir include:

1. Ontology as a Semantic Map: An ontology provides a systematic mapping of data to meaningful semantic concepts. It's about organizing data and creating a framework that gives that data context and meaning.

2. Common Vocabulary: Ontologies create a shared language across an organization, unifying disparate data sources and systems. This standardization of semantics is crucial for collaboration and dependent workflows.

3. Bridging Data and Applications: The ontology serves as connective tissue between raw data and applications. This separation allows for more efficient data integration and application development.

4. Dynamic and Flexible: An effective “ontology service” must be dynamic, allowing for the creation, modification, and deprecation of ontology elements as needs evolve.

5. Object-Oriented Approach: The emphasizes the importance of object classes, attributes, and relationships in building a robust ontology is central. This object-oriented approach allows for more intuitive data modeling and manipulation.

6. Embedded Logic: By incorporating functions and actions at the ontology level, organizations can standardize logic across applications, reducing redundancy and inconsistencies.

7. Security Integration: Integrating the ontology service with enterprise security architectures allow for more granular and consistent data access controls.

Perhaps the most important in my opinion: Palantir argues that an effective ontology allows a data ecosystem to grow and evolve over time in ways that create compounding value rather than increasing complexity. This scalability is crucial for organizations dealing with volumes and varieties of data, and let’s not even mention the need to plug AI agents on top.

Ontologies may be the key to unlocking the full potential of our information assets, it will enable organizations to tame the chaos of big data and create lean order from noise. The move to AI augmented business analytics will require this, the question isn't whether to implement ontologies or not, but how quickly we can bridge the knowledge gap on this matter, how we adapt our data strategies to incorporate these powerful concepts.

Have you noticed how data modeling is making a comeback in the AI world? It’s exciting to see ontology and data modeling stepping into the spotlight, reminding us just how crucial they are for effective data management.

Honestly, it’s been frustrating to watch data modeling take a backseat while we rushed to deploy new technologies over the past years. But now that AI systems are becoming more complex than just point-and-click dashboards, we’re realizing that a solid data model is essential. I see ontologies as a technique within data modeling that has been there forever to fully blossom as an engineering discipline in the data world. They help us define the classes, relationships, and rules that govern our data, hence making it easier for AI to understand and utilize that information effectively

One of the biggest challenges we face in AI development is alignment. It’s not enough to just launch a product and hope for the best. Data and AI developers need to step up and be accountable. If we don’t have a clear understanding of the outcomes users want, we risk creating systems that 1/ don’t deliver value but 2/ might lead users to make flawed decisions. AI is a too-good BS machine. That’s a huge risk!

This is where ontology engineering comes into play. Ontologies provide a shared vocabulary and become the config file of AI systems that align with our business goals and user needs, and enable auditability.

I also want to build this line of thoughts on the work of Joe Reis 🤓 and his "Mixed Martial Arts of Data Modeling." He shared this idea in a podcast I made with him earlier this year, and now he is writing his new book which I think will highlight how we can blend different data modeling techniques to create a more robust and flexible approach. Just like in MMA, where fighters combine various disciplines to become well-rounded, we can take a similar approach with data modeling to tackle the complexities of AI.

So, what do you think? How do you see the role of ontologies and data modeling coming to the rescue of AI?"""@en ;

    abi:content """How is AI reshaping enterprise management, and what crucial step are business leaders overlooking?

Putting AI systems to the heart of enterprise management is forcing a paradigm shift in how businesses operate and make decisions. As these systems become increasingly central to organizational processes, a critical realization will face decision-makers: the need to define their business as code through ontology engineering.

This approach involves meticulously mapping out business domains at both consolidated and atomic levels. It's not just about digitalization anymore, it's about creating a structured, machine-readable representation of your entire business ecosystem to « feed the AI ».

Why is this so crucial? Well, because AI is not intelligent magically. Without a clear, codified understanding of their business domains, organizations will struggle to:

1. Effectively integrate AI systems across their operations
2. Maintain consistency in decision-making processes
3. Scale their operations efficiently
4. Adapt quickly to market changes and new technologies

The implications of this shift are profound. Businesses that successfully implement ontology engineering will be better positioned to leverage AI technologies, streamline their operations, and respond more dynamically to market changes. They'll be able to create more sophisticated AI models that truly understand the nuances of their business, leading to more accurate predictions and better decision-making.

On top of that, this approach facilitates better communication and understanding across different departments and stakeholders. By having a shared, formalized representation of the business, teams can collaborate more effectively and align their efforts towards common goals.

The transition to this new paradigm is not going to happen overnight. It requires a significant investment of time and resources, as well as a shift in mindset.

So now, when you hear business leaders confidently declare, “Let’s give it to AI!” send them my way. I’ll help them see that before AI can work its magic, they need to map out their business, code it, and structure it with ontologies. Only then can AI truly deliver the intelligence they’re after. Without that foundation, they’re just setting themselves up for disappointment. Aïe, aïe, aïe!"""@en ;

    abi:content """What if the true power of AI lies not just in solving global problems, but in empowering each of us to control our own personalized AI through ontologies?

In his essay published last week, Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic outlines an ambitious vision of AI’s transformative potential on a global scale. He paints a future where powerful AI (aka AGI in openAI terms) could radically accelerate advances in healthcare, neuroscience, economic development, governance, and human well-being. His point is: AI has the capacity to compress decades of progress into just a few years, curing diseases, eliminating poverty, and potentially bringing about a new era of peace and prosperity.

The essay emphasizes the potential of centralized AI systems to solve complex global challenges. He highlights how AI, if deployed correctly, could revolutionize biology by accelerating research, finding cures for major diseases, and extending the human lifespan. In governance, he imagines AI could help strengthen democracies and improve decision-making by offering more impartial, data-driven insights. The essay is grounded in the idea that AI, once powerful enough, will fundamentally reshape society’s largest systems: healthcare, economy, and government…leading to a future where societal progress is vastly accelerated.

The problem is that the core thesis is focused almost exclusively on AI’s large-scale impacts and it overlooks a key aspect of AI’s potential: the empowerment of individuals. By concentrating on macro-level transformations, the discussion misses how AI could also be personalized and controlled by individuals through ontologies, making AI an private, collaborative, personal tool for everyone, not just a global force for systemic change.

Dario points out the risks and challenges associated with powerful AI, such as biases, potential misuse, and loss of control. But these concerns could be mitigated if AI systems were personalized and designed to reflect individual values, needs, and ethics. Ontologies, aka structured frameworks of knowledge, offer a way to enable this personalization. I see them as reality configuration files for AI. Rather than being passive users of large, centralized AI systems, individuals could actively shape their AI systems to work in alignment with their unique worldview, profession, or life goals.

Decentralizing AI through personalized control would allow people to define how AI interacts with their lives whether in managing personal data, automating tasks, making decisions that align with their personal values and ethics, working and sharing knowledge accumulated with an organization. 

This vision of AI as an extension of an individual’s knowledge and priorities could democratize its power, ensuring that AI serves not just the broader society but each person on a deeply personal level."""@en ;

The term "AI agent" has become synonym of hyper automation where humans are almost removed from the equation, but I don’t buy this, it's misleading. Here's why:

1. Agency implies autonomy and accountability. AI systems, no matter how advanced, don't possess these qualities. They execute tasks based on their programming and training data.

2. Using "agent" is leading to unrealistic expectations and misunderstandings about AI capabilities and limitations.

3. It blurs the line of responsibility. When things go wrong (and they will), who's accountable? The AI "agent"? Of course not. It's the humans and organizations behind the AI.

4. True agency involves moral reasoning and ethical decision-making - something AI is not capable of (yet, if ever).

5. Overuse of "agent" might lead to over-reliance on AI when humans are actually needed to take decisions.

Instead, the term "assistant" clearly conveys the supportive role of AI while maintaining the distinction between AI capabilities and human responsibilities.

"AI assistant" emphasizes that these systems are here to help and augment human capabilities, not replace human agency. It keeps the focus on the collaborative nature of human-AI interaction and reminds us that humans are still in the driver's seat."""@en ;

Ontologies create a shared language across an organization, unifying disparate data sources and systems. They serve as connective tissue between raw data and applications, allowing for efficient data integration and application development. An effective ontology must be dynamic, allowing for modification as needs evolve. The importance of object classes, attributes, and relationships in building a robust ontology is central. By incorporating functions and actions at the ontology level, organizations can standardize logic, reducing redundancy and inconsistencies. Integrating the ontology service with enterprise security architectures allow for more granular and consistent data access controls."@en .
