"""Secret Service Module

This module provides a unified interface for managing secrets across different storage systems.
The Secret service acts as a facade that coordinates multiple secret adapters, allowing applications
to retrieve, store, and manage secrets from various sources like environment variables, files,
cloud services, or other secret management systems.

The module implements the adapter pattern to support pluggable secret storage backends while
providing a consistent API for secret operations.

Classes:
    Secret: Main service class implementing ISecretService interface

Example:
    >>> from abi.services.secret.adapters import EnvVarSecretAdapter, FileSecretAdapter
    >>> adapters = [EnvVarSecretAdapter(), FileSecretAdapter("/path/to/secrets")]
    >>> secret_service = Secret(adapters)
    >>> api_key = secret_service.get("API_KEY", "default_key")
"""

    This service provides a unified interface for accessing secrets regardless of their storage location
    (environment variables, files, cloud services, etc.) through the use of adapters.

    Attributes:
        __adapter (ISecretAdapter): The adapter implementation used for retrieving secrets
            from the underlying storage system.

    Example:
        >>> secret_service = Secret(EnvVarSecretAdapter())
        >>> api_key = secret_service.get("API_KEY")

        Searches for the secret across all configured adapters in order. Returns the value
        from the first adapter that contains the key, or the default value if not found.

        Args:
            key (str): The secret key to retrieve.
            default (Any, optional): The value to return if the key is not found.
                Defaults to None.

        Returns:
            str: The secret value if found, otherwise the default value.

        Example:
            >>> secret_service = Secret([EnvVarSecretAdapter()])
            >>> database_url = secret_service.get("DATABASE_URL", "sqlite:///:memory:")

        Args:
            key (str): The secret key to set.
            value (str): The secret value to store.

        Note:
            If any adapter fails to set the value, the operation continues with
            remaining adapters. Consider implementing error handling based on
            your specific requirements.

        Example:
            >>> secret_service = Secret([EnvVarSecretAdapter(), FileSecretAdapter()])
            >>> secret_service.set("API_KEY", "your-secret-api-key")

        Deletes the specified key from all adapters. This ensures the secret
        is completely removed from all storage systems.

        Args:
            key (str): The secret key to remove.

        Note:
            If any adapter fails to remove the key, the operation continues with
            remaining adapters. The method does not raise exceptions for missing keys.

        Example:
            >>> secret_service = Secret([EnvVarSecretAdapter(), FileSecretAdapter()])
            >>> secret_service.remove("OLD_API_KEY")

        Combines secrets from all adapters into a single dictionary. When the same

        priority (earlier in the list) takes precedence.

        Returns:
            Dict[str, str]: A dictionary containing all secret key-value pairs.

        Note:
            The order of adapters matters for conflict resolution. Adapters are
            processed in reverse order, so earlier adapters override later ones.

        Example:
