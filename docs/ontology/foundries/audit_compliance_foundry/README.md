# Audit & Compliance Ontology Foundry

## Overview
The **Audit & Compliance Ontology Foundry** provides a comprehensive, modular set of ontological resources for modeling audit processes, compliance frameworks, regulatory requirements, governance structures, risk management, and evidence collection. It serves as a focal point for standardizing and integrating audit and compliance concepts across industries and regulatory domains.

## Mission
To create a universal, interoperable foundation for representing audit activities, compliance obligations, controls, evidence, and governance structures that can be extended to any regulatory domain while maintaining alignment with best practices in ontological engineering.

## Design Principles
1. **Regulatory Agnosticism**: Core patterns that work across regulatory frameworks (GDPR, SOX, HIPAA, etc.)
2. **Evidence-Centricity**: Strong focus on provenance, traceability, and documentary evidence
3. **Temporal Sensitivity**: Precise tracking of compliance states, control effectiveness, and audit events over time
4. **Modularity**: Components can be adopted independently based on organizational needs
5. **BFO Alignment**: All concepts properly aligned to Basic Formal Ontology categories for maximum interoperability

## Structure
The foundry is organized according to BFO's top-level distinctions:

### [Continuants](./Continuant/README.md)
Entities that persist through time while potentially undergoing change:
- **Independent Continuants**: Regulatory frameworks, control systems, evidence repositories
- **Specifically Dependent Continuants**: Compliance states, risk levels, control effectiveness
- **Generically Dependent Continuants**: Policies, procedures, attestations, evidence records

### [Occurrents](./Occurrent/README.md)
Processes and events that unfold over time:
- **Processes**: Audit activities, compliance monitoring, investigations
- **Process Boundaries**: Audit initiation/completion, compliance status changes
- **Temporal Regions**: Compliance periods, audit timeframes, remediation windows

## Core Ontology Modules

## Integration Points
- **Financial Systems**: Ties to FIBO (Financial Industry Business Ontology)
- **Legal Ontologies**: Extensions to LegalRuleML and LKIF
- **Security Standards**: Integration with cybersecurity ontologies (e.g., STIX)
- **Industry-Specific**: Customization points for healthcare, finance, manufacturing, etc.

## Applications
- Automated compliance monitoring
- Dynamic risk assessment
- Evidence collection and validation
- Audit planning and management
- Regulatory reporting
- Cross-framework compliance mapping
