# Audit & Compliance Ontology Foundry: Standards & Principles

## 1. Governance & Contribution

### 1.1 Foundry Governance
The Audit & Compliance Ontology Foundry is governed by a steering committee comprising experts in:
- Audit methodology
- Compliance frameworks
- Regulatory affairs
- Risk management
- Ontology engineering

### 1.2 Contribution Process
1. **Proposals** - New concepts, relations, or ontology modules must be proposed with clear definitions and alignment to BFO
2. **Review** - Technical review by ontology engineers and domain experts
3. **Testing** - Concept testing through competency questions and use cases
4. **Integration** - Formal adoption into the foundry with version control

### 1.3 Quality Criteria
All additions to the foundry must meet the following criteria:
- Alignment with BFO upper ontology
- Clear definitions with examples
- Domain expert validation
- Proper documentation
- Non-redundancy with existing concepts

## 2. Integration Standards

### 2.1 Ontology Organization
The foundry follows a modular architecture:
- **Core** - Fundamental audit and compliance concepts
- **Extensions** - Domain-specific modules (e.g., financial, healthcare, IT)
- **Bridges** - Mappings to other ontologies and frameworks
- **Axioms** - Logical constraints and rules

### 2.2 Namespace Conventions
- Prefix `acf:` for core foundry concepts
- Domain-specific extensions use `acf-[domain]:` (e.g., `acf-fin:`, `acf-health:`)
- Version-specific concepts use `acf-[version]:` when needed

### 2.3 Versioning
- Major version changes for significant structural modifications
- Minor version changes for concept additions or refinements
- Patch version changes for documentation updates or error corrections
- All changes documented in a changelog

### 2.4 Documentation Requirements
Each ontology module requires:
- Overall purpose and scope document
- Competency questions it addresses
- Alignment and integration points
- Usage examples and patterns
- Term definitions and hierarchies

## 3. Conceptual Standards

### 3.1 Regulatory Agnosticism Principle
Core concepts should be applicable across regulatory domains with extensions for specific regulations.

**Example**:
- `acf:ComplianceRequirement` is regulatory-agnostic
- `acf-gdpr:DataSubjectRight` is a GDPR-specific extension

### 3.2 Evidence Centricity Principle
Evidence concepts must support strong provenance, traceability, and chain of custody.

**Example**:
- All evidence classes must support `acf:hasProvenance`, `acf:hasTimeStamp`, and `acf:hasEvidenceSource`

### 3.3 Temporal Sensitivity Principle
All compliance states and assessments must be temporally qualified.

**Example**:
- Compliance assertions use `acf:hasAssessmentDate` and `acf:hasValidityPeriod`

### 3.4 Modularity Principle
Components should be designed for independent adoption while maintaining integration capabilities.

**Example**:
- Risk assessment module can be used separately from audit module but shares common foundations

### 3.5 Semantic Precision Principle
Terms must have precise, non-overlapping definitions that capture the essence of audit and compliance concepts.

**Example**:
- Clear distinction between `acf:Control`, `acf:ControlObjective`, and `acf:ControlActivity`

## 4. Technical Implementation

### 4.1 Formalism
- Primary formalism: OWL2-DL
- Supplementary: SHACL constraints for validation
- Query support: SPARQL templates for common compliance queries

### 4.2 Tooling Standards
- Protégé for ontology development
- GitHub for version control
- CI/CD for automated testing
- Documentation generation from ontology annotations

### 4.3 Validation Methods
- Logical consistency checks
- Competency question validation
- Expert review cycles
- Test cases with sample data

## 5. Integration with External Ontologies

### 5.1 Required Alignments
- Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) for upper-level alignment
- Common Core Ontologies (CCO) for mid-level concepts
- Information Artifact Ontology (IAO) for documentation concepts
- PROV-O for provenance tracking

### 5.2 Optional Integrations
- FIBO for financial compliance
- LegalRuleML for legal rule representation
- XBRL ontology mappings for financial reporting
- GDPR ontologies for privacy compliance

### 5.3 Mapping Strategy
- Direct subsumption where appropriate
- Equivalence assertions for semantic alignment
- Bridge ontologies for complex mappings
- Documented alignment patterns

## 6. Usage & Adoption

### 6.1 Implementation Levels
1. **Level 1**: Core concepts only (minimal implementation)
2. **Level 2**: Core + domain-specific extensions
3. **Level 3**: Full integration with reasoning and rules

### 6.2 Application Patterns
- Compliance monitoring systems
- Audit management platforms
- Regulatory reporting solutions
- GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance) systems
- Automated control testing frameworks

### 6.3 Usage Metrics
The foundry will track:
- Adoption across organizations
- Extensions by domain
- Integration with commercial tools
- Academic and research applications

## 7. Maintenance & Evolution

### 7.1 Regular Review Cycle
- Annual comprehensive review
- Quarterly minor updates
- Continuous bug fixes and documentation improvements

### 7.2 Extension Process
- Domain-specific extension proposals
- Industry working groups for specialized modules
- Collaborative development of emerging regulatory areas

### 7.3 Deprecation Policy
- 12-month deprecation notice for major concept changes
- Migration paths documented for all deprecations
- Versioned archives of all prior releases

## 8. Community & Resources

### 8.1 Communication Channels
