# Personal AI Ontology Foundry

## Overview
The **Personal AI Ontology Foundry** provides a comprehensive, modular set of ontological resources for modeling personal AI systems, user interactions, personalization mechanisms, trust dynamics, capability frameworks, and memory systems. It serves as a focal point for standardizing and integrating personal AI concepts across applications and domains.

## Mission
To create a universal, interoperable foundation for representing personal AI capabilities, user-AI relationships, personalization mechanics, and ethical frameworks that can be extended to any AI application while maintaining alignment with best practices in ontological engineering. The foundry aims to empower individuals with data sovereignty, restore agency over digital experiences, and create AI systems that serve human flourishing.

## Design Principles
1. **User-Centricity**: Core patterns that prioritize user agency, preferences, and control
2. **Memory-Driven Personalization**: Strong focus on user memory, context retention, and adaptive learning
3. **Interaction Fluency**: Precise modeling of natural, context-aware interactions over time
4. **Modularity**: Components can be adopted independently based on application needs
5. **BFO Alignment**: All concepts properly aligned to Basic Formal Ontology categories for maximum interoperability
6. **Data Sovereignty**: Systems designed with user ownership and control of data as fundamental principles
7. **Local-First Architecture**: Processing occurs on user-owned devices before considering cloud computation
8. **Cross-Domain Integration**: Seamless connection between different life domains through the Personal AI Flywheel

## Structure
The foundry is organized according to BFO's top-level distinctions:

### [Continuants](./Continuant/README.md)
Entities that persist through time while potentially undergoing change:
- **Independent Continuants**: AI agents, user identities, model architectures, personal data stores
- **Specifically Dependent Continuants**: AI roles, user roles, capabilities, trust levels
- **Generically Dependent Continuants**: Personalization models, prompt templates, user memories

### [Occurrents](./Occurrent/README.md)
Processes and events that unfold over time:
- **Processes**: AI interactions, personalization learning, reasoning, feedback collection
- **Process Boundaries**: Interaction initiation, model update events
- **Temporal Regions**: Interaction sessions, adaptation periods

## The Personal AI Flywheel

The Personal AI Flywheel represents a self-reinforcing cycle where data and insights from different life domains continuously enhance each other:

```
Health/Wellness → Learning → Finance → Social → Content → Productivity → Health/Wellness
```

Each domain transition represents a `paf:CrossDomainEnrichmentProcess` where:

1. **Health & Wellness Data** (`paf:HealthDataStore`) provides biological context that personalizes learning experiences based on cognitive state, energy levels, and chronobiology
2. **Learning Progress** (`paf:LearningMemory`) informs financial decision-making through applied knowledge and skill development
3. **Financial Stability** (`paf:FinancialDataStore`) enables more meaningful social interactions by reducing stress and creating opportunity
4. **Social Interactions** (`paf:SocialDataStore`) refine content recommendations through relational context and shared interests
5. **Content Consumption** (`paf:ContentMemory`) introduces new concepts that enhance productivity systems
6. **Productivity Patterns** (`paf:ProductivityDataStore`) optimize health routines by creating time-space for wellbeing activities

This flywheel creates a virtuous cycle where each domain reinforces others while maintaining user agency, data ownership, and value creation aligned with personal goals.

## Integration Points
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Ties to existing knowledge graph standards
- **Language Models**: Extensions to transformer and language model ontologies
- **Security Standards**: Integration with privacy and security ontologies
- **Domain-Specific**: Customization points for workplace, creativity, education, etc.
- **Federated Identity**: Integration with decentralized identity frameworks
- **Data Vaults**: Connection to personal data storage architectures

## Applications

- Multi-modal interaction systems
- Ethical AI governance
- Cross-platform AI continuity
- Personal data monetization platforms
- Unified contact and communications systems
