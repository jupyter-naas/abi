# ConflictResolutionProcess

## Definition
ConflictResolutionProcess is an occurrent process that systematically identifies, analyzes, and resolves data conflicts between contact records from multiple sources, applying user preferences and resolution strategies to establish data consistency while preserving data sovereignty.

## Overview
The ConflictResolutionProcess is responsible for addressing and resolving data inconsistencies that emerge when integrating contact information from multiple platforms. This process is triggered when conflicting attribute values are detected during the ContactMergingProcess or when synchronization reveals inconsistencies between platforms.

This process employs sophisticated strategies to resolve conflicts, ranging from automated rule-based approaches to user-guided decision making. It considers attribute quality, source reliability, update timestamps, and user preferences to determine the most appropriate resolution for each conflict. The process respects data sovereignty principles by ensuring users maintain ultimate control over conflict resolution decisions while providing intelligent assistance.

By systematically addressing conflicts, this process ensures data consistency across the personal contact ecosystem while maintaining data integrity and user trust in the integrated contact representation.
