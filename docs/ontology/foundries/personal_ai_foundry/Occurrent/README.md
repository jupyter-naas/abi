# Occurrents in Personal AI Ontology

## Overview

In the Personal AI Ontology Foundry, occurrents represent entities that unfold or develop through time. Following BFO (Basic Formal Ontology) principles, we organize occurrents into four main categories:

1. **Processes**: Dynamic entities that have temporal parts and exist in time
2. **Process Boundaries**: Instantaneous temporal boundaries of processes
3. **Spatiotemporal Regions**: Regions defined by both space and time
4. **Temporal Regions**: Regions defined solely by time

This organization provides a robust foundation for representing the dynamic aspects of personal AI systems, including user interactions, learning processes, and temporal contexts.

## Usage Guidelines

When extending the occurrent hierarchy:

1. Ensure clear temporal boundaries for all processes
2. Distinguish between the process itself and its participants
3. Specify the temporal regions during which processes occur
4. Model process dependencies and sequential relationships
5. Maintain consistent granularity within process hierarchies
6. Document process inputs, outputs, and preconditions
7. Ensure all processes respect user consent and data sovereignty
8. Define how cross-domain processes maintain context while crossing boundaries
9. Specify sovereignty constraints on each process type
10. Document how the process contributes to the overall Personal AI Flywheel
