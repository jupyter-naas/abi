# SynchronizationBoundary

## Definition
A SynchronizationBoundary is an occurrent process boundary that represents the precise temporal demarcation and contextual edge conditions that define the initiation, transitions between stages, and completion of a contact synchronization process, establishing crucial state changes and decision points.

## Overview
A SynchronizationBoundary represents the critical junctures in time and state where distinct changes occur during contact synchronization processes. Unlike the processes themselves, which have temporal duration, these boundaries are instantaneous occurrents that mark significant transitions in the synchronization workflow.

These boundaries are essential for reasoning about the precise moments of state change, transaction integrity, error conditions, and authorization checks in synchronization processes. By explicitly modeling boundaries, the system can maintain a clear record of when synchronization states changed, what conditions existed at those moments, what decisions were made, and what triggered transitions between process phases.

This approach enables sophisticated governance of synchronization processes, providing the foundation for atomicity, isolation, resumption, and accountability in cross-platform data operations, while supporting fine-grained user sovereignty through boundary-specific permission enforcement and intervention points.

const boundary = boundaryService.createBoundary({
  type: BoundaryType.StageTransition,
  processId: "sync-process-123",
  fromStage: ProcessStage.DataAcquisition,
  toStage: ProcessStage.ConflictResolution,
  trigger: {
    type: TriggerType.Automatic,
    cause: "DataAcquisitionComplete"
  }
});

// Checking if we can proceed
if (boundary.requiresUserIntervention()) {
  await userNotificationService.requestDecision(boundary);
  return; // Will resume after user decides
}

// Proceeding to next stage
if (boundary.wasSuccessful()) {
  processManager.advanceToStage(boundary.processId, boundary.toStage);
} else {
  errorHandlingService.handleFailedTransition(boundary);
}

// Finding boundary history
const processBoundaries = await boundaryRepository.findByProcessId("sync-process-123");
const userDecisionPoints = processBoundaries.filter(b => b.decisions.some(d => d.requiresUserInput));
