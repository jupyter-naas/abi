# Continuants in Personal AI Ontology

## Overview

In the Personal AI Ontology Foundry, continuants represent entities that persist through time while maintaining their identity, even as they potentially undergo changes. Following BFO (Basic Formal Ontology) principles, we organize continuants into three main categories:

1. **Independent Continuants**: Entities that exist on their own
2. **Specifically Dependent Continuants**: Entities that depend on specific bearers
3. **Generically Dependent Continuants**: Patterns that can be replicated across different bearers

This organization provides a robust foundation for representing the enduring elements of personal AI systems, their properties, and the information artifacts they manipulate.

## Independent Continuants

Independent continuants in the Personal AI domain include concrete entities that exist without requiring specific bearers:

### AI Agents
- **AI Agent**: The computational entity capable of perceiving its environment and taking actions to accomplish goals
- **Model Architecture**: The structural design and organization of an AI model or system
- **Language Model**: A computational model specifically trained to understand and generate natural language

### User Entities
- **User Identity**: The digital representation of a person's identity that interacts with AI systems
- **User Device**: Physical devices through which the user interacts with AI systems
- **User Group**: Collections of users that share common characteristics or permissions

### Data Infrastructure
- **Personal Data Store**: Repository for storing personal data, memories, and user artifacts
- **Knowledge Graph**: Structured representation of facts, entities, and their relationships
- **Vector Store**: Repository for storing embedded representations of content

### Contextual Boundaries
- **AI Context**: The situational and environmental information that frames AI interactions
- **Interaction Scope**: The defined boundaries of AI-user interactions and capabilities
- **Security Boundary**: Defined perimeters that control access to and from AI systems

## Specifically Dependent Continuants

Specifically dependent continuants in the Personal AI domain include qualities, roles, and functions that depend on specific bearers:

### Roles
- **User Role**: The role of a person interacting with and utilizing AI systems
- **AI Role**: The specific purpose or character that an AI system assumes in relation to users
- **Administrator Role**: The role of an entity that has governance authority over AI systems

### Functions
- **Personalization Function**: The function of adapting AI responses to match user preferences
- **Reasoning Function**: The function of processing inputs and generating outputs through logical operations
- **Memory Retrieval Function**: The function of accessing and retrieving stored information

### Qualities
- **AI Capability**: The quality reflecting a specific ability of an AI system
- **Trust Level**: The quality reflecting the assessed degree of trust between user and AI
- **Privacy Sensitivity**: The quality reflecting the degree of privacy concern for specific data
- **Confidence Level**: The quality reflecting the degree of certainty in AI outputs

### Dispositions
- **Adaptability**: The disposition to change in response to user behavior patterns
- **Explainability**: The disposition to provide understandable rationales for decisions
- **Reliability**: The disposition to function consistently as expected

## Generically Dependent Continuants

Generically dependent continuants in the Personal AI domain include patterns and information artifacts that can exist in multiple bearers:

### Models & Representations
- **Personalization Model**: A model representing user preferences and behaviors for AI adaptation
- **User Memory**: Information about user interactions preserved for future AI interactions
- **Knowledge Representation**: Structured information about domains, concepts, and their relationships

### Templates & Patterns
- **Prompt Template**: Structured format for generating effective prompts
- **Conversation Pattern**: Recurring structure in dialogue between user and AI
- **Task Definition**: Specification of work to be performed by an AI system

### Documentation & Explanations
- **AI Explanation**: Formal representation of the rationale behind an AI decision
- **User Manual**: Documentation explaining AI capabilities and interaction methods
- **Provenance Record**: Information about the origin and lineage of data or outputs

## Relationships Between Continuant Types

The power of this ontological approach comes from modeling the relationships between different types of continuants:

1. **Independent-Specific Dependencies**:
   - AI Agents *bear* AI Capabilities
   - User Identities *bear* User Roles
   - Personal Data Stores *bear* Privacy Sensitivity

2. **Independent-Generic Instantiations**:
   - AI Agents *instantiate* Personalization Models
   - Personal Data Stores *instantiate* User Memories
   - User Identities *instantiate* User Preferences

3. **Cross-Category Relationships**:
   - AI Capabilities *enable* AI Functions
   - User Roles *determine* Interaction Scopes
   - Task Definitions *guide* Reasoning Functions

## Integration Points

This continuant framework integrates with:

1. **Occurrent framework**: Continuants participate in processes and events
2. **External ontologies**: Alignments with cognitive computing and HCI ontologies
3. **Domain extensions**: Specialized continuants for workplace, education, or creative domains

## Usage Guidelines

When extending the continuant hierarchy:

1. Maintain clear BFO alignment for all new classes
2. Document dependencies between continuants explicitly
3. Provide examples of instantiation for generically dependent continuants
4. Specify qualities with measurable or observable characteristics
5. Define roles in terms of the social contexts they exist within
