# Personal AI Ontology Foundry: Standards & Principles

## 1. Governance & Contribution

### 1.1 Foundry Governance
The Personal AI Ontology Foundry is governed by a steering committee comprising experts in:
- AI systems design
- Cognitive computing
- Human-computer interaction
- Data privacy and ethics
- Ontology engineering
- Digital sovereignty and rights

### 1.2 Contribution Process
1. **Proposals** - New concepts, relations, or ontology modules must be proposed with clear definitions and alignment to BFO
2. **Review** - Technical review by ontology engineers and domain experts
3. **Testing** - Concept testing through competency questions and use cases
4. **Integration** - Formal adoption into the foundry with version control

### 1.3 Quality Criteria
All additions to the foundry must meet the following criteria:
- Alignment with BFO upper ontology
- Clear definitions with examples
- Domain expert validation
- Proper documentation
- Non-redundancy with existing concepts
- Support for data sovereignty principles
- Respect for user agency and control

## 2. Integration Standards

### 2.1 Ontology Organization
The foundry follows a modular architecture:
- **Core** - Fundamental personal AI concepts
- **Extensions** - Domain-specific modules (e.g., workplace, creativity, education)
- **Bridges** - Mappings to other ontologies and frameworks
- **Axioms** - Logical constraints and rules
- **Flywheel** - Cross-domain enrichment patterns

### 2.2 Namespace Conventions
- Prefix `paf:` for core foundry concepts
- Domain-specific extensions use `paf-[domain]:` (e.g., `paf-work:`, `paf-create:`)
- Version-specific concepts use `paf-[version]:` when needed
- Flywheel components use `paf-wheel:[domain]` (e.g., `paf-wheel:health`)

### 2.3 Versioning
- Major version changes for significant structural modifications
- Minor version changes for concept additions or refinements
- Patch version changes for documentation updates or error corrections
- All changes documented in a changelog

### 2.4 Documentation Requirements
Each ontology module requires:
- Overall purpose and scope document
- Competency questions it addresses
- Alignment and integration points
- Usage examples and patterns
- Term definitions and hierarchies
- Sovereignty and agency considerations

## 3. Conceptual Standards

### 3.1 User-Centricity Principle
Core concepts should prioritize user agency, control, and preferences with clear boundaries for AI capabilities.

**Example**:
- `paf:UserPreference` takes precedence over `paf:AIRecommendation`
- `paf:UserConsent` is required for `paf:DataCollection`

### 3.2 Memory-Driven Personalization Principle
Memory concepts must support personalization, contextual awareness, and adaptive learning.

**Example**:
- All memory classes must support `paf:hasTimeStamp`, `paf:hasSource`, and `paf:hasConfidenceScore`

### 3.3 Interaction Fluency Principle
All interaction models must be temporally grounded and context-aware.

**Example**:
- Conversation models use `paf:hasSessionContext` and `paf:refersToEarlierInteraction`

### 3.4 Modularity Principle
Components should be designed for independent adoption while maintaining integration capabilities.

**Example**:
- Personalization module can be used separately from interaction module but shares common memory foundations

### 3.5 Semantic Precision Principle
Terms must have precise, non-overlapping definitions that capture the essence of personal AI concepts.

**Example**:
- Clear distinction between `paf:UserIntent`, `paf:ExplicitRequest`, and `paf:ImpliedNeed`

### 3.6 Data Sovereignty Principle
Personal data ownership, control, and governance must be encoded at the foundational level.

**Example**:
- All data entities must have explicit `paf:hasOwner` relations
- Processing actions require `paf:hasConsent` relations
- Data transfers must respect `paf:PrivacyBoundary` constraints

### 3.7 Local-First Processing Principle
Computation should occur on user-controlled devices whenever possible before considering cloud alternatives.

**Example**:
- Processing flows include explicit `paf:LocalProcessingAttempt` before `paf:CloudProcessingFallback`
- Sensitive operations must include `paf:LocalComputationVerification`

### 3.8 Cross-Domain Integration Principle
Models should support seamless integration of insights across different life domains.

**Example**:
- Domain-specific data stores connect through `paf:enriches` relations
- Cross-domain processes must document their `paf:contributesToDomain` targets

## 4. Technical Implementation
