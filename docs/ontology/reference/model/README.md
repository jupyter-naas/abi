# ABI Ontology Model Reference

This directory contains the auto-generated technical reference documentation for the ABI Ontology model. These files represent the formal structure, relationships, and implementation details of the ontology as defined in the source codebase.

## Contents

- Entity relationship models
- Class hierarchies and inheritance relationships
- Object and data property specifications
- Axioms and constraints
- Technical metadata

## Purpose

This reference documentation:

- Provides a technical view of the ontology's implementation
- Serves as the authoritative representation of model structures
- Documents mappings between BFO, CCO, and domain-specific extensions
- Supports developers and ontology engineers working with the implementation

## Relationship to Foundries

While the foundry documentation provides human-readable conceptual explanations, this model reference documents the actual implementation details that formalize those concepts in machine-readable formats.

## Usage Guidelines

- Reference these documents when implementing systems that interface with the ABI Ontology
- Consult this directory for technical specification details when extending the ontology
- Use as the source of truth for semantic relationships between ontology classes

## Regeneration

This documentation is automatically generated from the ontology source code. Manual changes should not be made to these files, as they will be overwritten during the next generation cycle.
