# Spherical Coordinate System (https://www.commoncoreontologies.org/ont00000729)

## Definition
A Spatial Reference System for three-dimensional spatial regions that identifies each point using an ordered triple of numerical coordinates that consist of the radial distance of the point of interest from a fixed origin, its polar angle measured from a fixed zenith direction, and the azimuth angle of its orthogonal projection measured from a fixed direction on a reference plane that passes through the origin and is orthogonal to the zenith.
