# Capability-Driven Process Derivation: Complete Implementation
*Process-Capability Mapping Analysis - Supporting [ABI Ontological Evolution](./README.md)*

> **Note**: This analysis informed our process-centric routing approach in the [Initial Approach](./01_Initial_Approach.md). Current process-capability relationships are now dynamically maintained in the knowledge graph via [SPARQL queries](./02_Current_State.md#sparql-based-agent-recommendation).

## **🎯 MISSION ACCOMPLISHED**

Bottom-up approach where processes are **derived from actual AI model capabilities** rather than imposed from the top down. Successfully implemented using BFO ontology and real capability extraction.

## **🎉 CONCLUSION: ONTOLOGICAL REVOLUTION COMPLETE**

We've successfully transformed ABI from a **model-centric** to a **process-centric** AI system using:

1. **BFO 7 Buckets** as the ontological foundation
2. **Capability Extraction** from actual model documentation  
3. **Process Derivation** from clustered capabilities
4. **Smart Routing** based on context and optimization criteria
5. **Transparent Reasoning** for every routing decision

The result is an intelligent AI orchestration system that **thinks in terms of what needs to be done** rather than which tool to use. This represents a fundamental shift toward more intuitive, efficient, and scalable AI interaction.
