| **4. Processes** (HOW-IT-HAPPENS) | `BFO_4_Processes_HOW_IT_HAPPENS` | CORE PROCESS: Truth-Seeking Analysis - Pursue truth through contrarian analysis; Execution via optimal model selection |
| **5. Temporal Regions** (WHEN) | `BFO_5_Temporal_Regions_WHEN` | 24/7 availability; Response time: ~0.3-1.0s first token; Execution duration: Variable by complexity |
| **6. Spatial Regions** (WHERE) | `BFO_6_Spatial_Regions_WHERE` | Deployment: US-based; API endpoints: Multiple regions; Data processing: Distributed |
| **7. Information Entities** (HOW-WE-KNOW) | `BFO_7_Information_Entities_HOW_WE_KNOW` | Process documentation; Model capability specifications; Performance metrics; Routing decisions |

## **üéØ VERIFICATION CHECKPOINTS**

### **‚úÖ Ontological Consistency**
- All 18 processes mapped to complete BFO 7 buckets framework
- Material Entities identify specific AI models and users
- Qualities include intelligence, speed, cost metrics from actual data
- Realizable Entities describe specific capabilities from extracted data
- Processes are the core derived capabilities themselves
- Temporal/Spatial regions reflect real deployment characteristics
- Information Entities include documentation and performance data

### **‚úÖ Data Integrity**
- Process IDs: P001-P018 (systematic identification)
- Intelligence Range: 43-73 (from actual model measurements)
- Speed Range: 86.9-646.0 t/s (from benchmark data)
- Cost Range: $0.23-$30.00/1M (from published pricing)
- Supporting Models: Derived from actual capability extraction

### **‚úÖ Capability Validation**
- **293 original capabilities** extracted from READMEs
- **31 initial processes** derived through clustering
- **18 final processes** with complete BFO mapping
- **Bottom-up derivation** from actual model documentation
- **No imposed assumptions** - everything derived from evidence

## **üîç VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY**

### **How to Validate**
1. **Open** `BFO_Process_Mapping_20250804_134337.csv` in Excel/Google Sheets
2. **Check Process IDs** P001-P018 for completeness
3. **Verify BFO Mapping** - each process should have all 7 buckets filled
4. **Cross-Reference** supporting models with original capability analysis
5. **Validate Exclusivity** - exclusive processes should only have 1 supporting model
6. **Check Intelligence/Speed/Cost** ranges against known model specifications

### **Key Validation Points**
- **BFO Bucket 4** should contain the actual process definition
- **Supporting Models** should match capability extraction results
- **Exclusive processes** should align with unique model capabilities
- **Universal processes** should be supported by most/all models
- **Intelligence ranges** should reflect actual model scores
- **Use cases** should be specific and actionable

## **üíé COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE**

### **Unique Capabilities Identified**
- **Grok's Truth-Seeking**: Only model designed for contrarian analysis (Intelligence 73)
- **Gemini's Multimodal**: Only major LLM with native image generation
- **Claude's Constitutional AI**: Only model with built-in ethical reasoning framework
- **Mistral's European Sovereignty**: Only model with GDPR compliance by design
- **Llama's Context Processing**: Tied for largest context window (10M tokens)

### **Strategic Positioning**
