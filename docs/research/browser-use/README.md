# Browser-Use Integration Research

## Overview

This research explores the integration of [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) into ABI, enabling AI agents to control browsers and automate web tasks. Browser-use is a powerful library that makes websites accessible for AI agents, allowing them to interact with web interfaces naturally.

## Research Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Web Automation Capabilities**: Enable ABI agents to perform complex web tasks automatically
2. **Browser Control Integration**: Seamlessly integrate browser automation into the existing agent framework
3. **Multi-Agent Web Workflows**: Coordinate multiple agents for complex web-based operations
4. **Enterprise Web Integration**: Support for corporate web applications and workflows

### Secondary Goals
1. **MCP Integration**: Leverage Model Context Protocol for enhanced capabilities
2. **Cross-Platform Support**: Ensure compatibility across different operating systems
3. **Security & Privacy**: Implement secure browser automation practices
4. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient resource usage for browser operations

## Current State vs Target State

### Current State
- ABI operates as a multi-agent system with text-based interactions
- Limited web capabilities through API integrations
- No direct browser automation or visual web interaction
- Agents communicate through traditional text interfaces

### Target State
- **Browser-Enabled Agents**: AI agents can directly control browsers and interact with web pages
- **Visual Web Understanding**: Agents can see and interact with web interfaces like humans
- **Automated Web Workflows**: Complex multi-step web operations automated end-to-end
- **Hybrid Capabilities**: Seamless combination of API calls and browser automation
