# Workflows Architecture

Workflows in ABI are specialized components designed to implement specific intents or business logic. They serve as the bridge between user or agent intentions and the actual execution of those intentions using ABI's capabilities.

## Design Philosophy

Workflows are designed to be:
1. **Intent-focused**: Implement specific business intents rather than technical operations
2. **Composable**: Can be combined by agents to fulfill complex requirements
3. **Technology-agnostic**: Abstract away specific implementation details
4. **Multi-interface**: Exposable through multiple interfaces (API, LLM tools)

## Workflow Structure

The Workflow Class is structured to include several key components:

1. **Configuration Class**: This class holds references to the necessary integrations, pipelines, and services that the workflow will utilize.

2. **Parameters Class**: This class defines the runtime parameters required for the workflow, including validation rules and default values for these parameters.

3. **run() Method**: This method is responsible for implementing the business logic of the workflow. It will call the relevant pipelines and integrations, and process the results obtained from these calls.

4. **Interface Exposure**: The workflow can expose its functionality through various interfaces, including the `as_tools()` method for integration with tools and the `as_api()` method for API exposure.

## Key Components

1. **Workflow Configuration Class**:
   - Dataclass extending `WorkflowConfiguration`
   - Contains references to required services and components
   - Defines how the workflow connects to other system parts

2. **Workflow Parameters Class**:
   - Pydantic model extending `WorkflowParameters`
   - Defines runtime parameters with validation rules
   - Documents parameter usage with descriptions

3. **Workflow Class**:
   - Extends the base `Workflow` class
   - Implements the `run()` method containing business logic
   - Implements the `as_tools()` method to expose as LLM tools
   - Implements the `as_api()` method to expose as API endpoints
