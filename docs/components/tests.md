# Tests

## Overview

ABI Tests are specialized components designed to validate the functionality, reliability, and correctness of modules and their components. Tests ensure that each part of a module works as expected in isolation and when integrated with other components, providing confidence in the system's behavior and making it easier to maintain and extend the codebase.

## Purpose and Benefits

Tests serve several key functions in the ABI ecosystem:

- **Quality Assurance**: Verify that components function correctly and meet requirements
- **Regression Prevention**: Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
- **Documentation**: Serve as executable documentation of expected behavior
- **Design Improvement**: Encourage modular, testable design patterns
- **Confident Refactoring**: Enable safe refactoring and code improvements
- **Integration Validation**: Confirm that components work together properly

## Testing Frameworks and Tools

ABI supports multiple testing frameworks and approaches:

1. **pytest**: Primary testing framework for writing and executing tests
2. **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management for testing configurations and parameters
3. **unittest.mock**: For mocking external dependencies and services
4. **hypothesis**: For property-based testing of complex functions
5. **pytest-cov**: For measuring test coverage

## Best Practices

When developing ABI Tests:

1. **Pure Functions**: Write tests for pure functions wherever possible
2. **Test Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on others
3. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure tests using the AAA pattern
4. **Use Fixtures**: Extract common setup into pytest fixtures
5. **Mock External Dependencies**: Use mocking to isolate the code under test
6. **Parameterized Tests**: Use pytest.mark.parametrize for testing multiple cases
7. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical paths
8. **Property-Based Tests**: Use hypothesis for testing complex functions with many input variations
9. **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
10. **Test Documentation**: Include docstrings in tests to explain their purpose

## Examples

ABI includes several example test components that demonstrate best practices:

- **Integration Tests**: Tests for communication with external services
- **Pipeline Tests**: Tests for data transformation logic
- **Workflow Tests**: Tests for business logic implementation
- **App Tests**: Tests for user interfaces
- **Analytics Tests**: Tests for reporting and visualization

You can find these examples in the `src/core/modules/common/tests/` directory.
