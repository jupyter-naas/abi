# Testing Your Project Setup

This guide explains how to ensure your project is properly set up and working correctly by running some basic tests.

## Prerequisites

Before running tests, make sure:

1. You have all dependencies installed
2. Your environment variables are properly configured
3. You have the necessary permissions to run the project commands

## Running the Terminal Agent

To verify your project setup, start by running the terminal agent. The terminal agent provides an interactive interface to test basic functionality.

To test it, use the `make` command:

```bash
# Run the default test suite
make
```

This will verify that the ABI Super Assistant is functioning correctly. Look for any error messages or failed tests in the output.

## Building and Testing the API

To test the API component of the project:

```bash
# Build and start the API
make api
```

After running this command, the API should be running on your local machine. You can test by clicking on the link in the terminal output:

```
INFO:     Will watch for changes in these directories: ['/app']
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:9879 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [1] using WatchFiles
INFO:     Started server process [26]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

This will open the Swagger documentation where you can interactively test the API endpoints.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during testing:

1. Check that all dependencies are installed correctly
2. Verify your environment variables are set properly
3. Look for error messages in the console output
4. Check the logs directory for more detailed error information

## Next Steps

Once you've confirmed your project is working correctly, you can proceed to:

- Developing new features
- Creating custom modules
- Integrating with external services
```
