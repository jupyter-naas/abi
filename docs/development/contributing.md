# Contributing

This guide explains how to contribute to the ABI framework, from setting up your development environment to submitting pull requests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin contributing, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Docker (for running some tests and development containers)
- A code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Fork the Repository**

   Start by forking the ABI repository to your own GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button on the repository page.

2. **Clone Your Fork**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/abi.git
   cd abi
   ```

3. **Set Up the Upstream Remote**

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/abi.git
   ```

4. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

5. **Install Development Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

6. **Install Pre-commit Hooks**

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

We follow a simple branching strategy:

- `main`: The main branch contains stable code that is ready for production.
- `develop`: The development branch contains code being prepared for the next release.
- Feature branches: Created from `develop` for specific features or bug fixes.

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Making Changes

1. Make your changes following our [code style guidelines](code-style.md).
2. Write or update tests following our [testing guidelines](testing.md).
3. Run the tests to make sure everything passes:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```
4. Commit your changes with a clear message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: brief description of what you did"
   ```

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Push your branch to your fork**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request**

   Go to GitHub and create a pull request from your branch to the `develop` branch of the main repository.

3. **Pull Request Template**

   Your pull request should include:
   - A clear title and description
   - Reference to any related issues
   - List of changes made
   - Screenshots or examples (if applicable)

4. **Code Review**

   Maintainers will review your code and may suggest changes. Be responsive to feedback and make necessary adjustments.

5. **Continuous Integration**

   All pull requests must pass the CI pipeline, which runs tests, linting, and other checks.

## Types of Contributions

### Bug Fixes

1. Check if the bug is already reported in the Issues section.
2. If not, create a new issue describing the bug in detail.
3. Include steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
4. If you're fixing the bug:
   - Reference the issue in your pull request
   - Include tests that verify the fix

### Feature Additions

1. Discuss new features in the Issues section before implementing.
2. Create a detailed proposal explaining the feature and its benefits.
3. Once approved, implement the feature with appropriate tests and documentation.

### Documentation Improvements

1. Documentation improvements are always welcome!
2. For small changes (typos, clarifications), you can submit a PR directly.
3. For larger changes, create an issue first to discuss the proposed changes.

## Component-Specific Guidelines

### Assistants

- Ensure assistants are well-documented with clear capabilities
- Include examples of typical interactions
- Test with a variety of inputs and edge cases

### Integrations

- Document all API endpoints and parameters
- Include error handling for various failure modes
- Test with mock external services

### Pipelines

- Ensure efficient data processing
- Document input and output formats
- Include validation for all inputs

### Workflows

- Document workflow steps and dependencies
- Test with various parameter combinations
- Include error recovery mechanisms

### Ontology

- Follow established semantic web standards
- Document all classes and properties
- Include validation for data consistency

## Community

### Communication Channels

- **GitHub Issues**: For bug reports and feature discussions
- **Discord**: For real-time discussions and community support
- **Mailing List**: For announcements and broader discussions

### Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). In summary:

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully
- Focus on what's best for the community
- Show empathy towards other community members
