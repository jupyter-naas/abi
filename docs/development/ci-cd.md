# Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment

This document outlines the CI/CD processes and best practices for the ABI framework, detailing our approach to automated testing, code quality checks, and deployment.

## CI/CD Overview

Our CI/CD pipeline automates the process of integrating code changes, running tests, ensuring code quality, and deploying to different environments. This ensures that code changes are thoroughly validated before being released.

## CI/CD Tools

We use the following tools in our CI/CD pipeline:

- **GitHub Actions**: Primary CI/CD platform
- **pytest**: Test framework
- **Black**: Code formatting
- **Flake8**: Code linting
- **Mypy**: Static type checking
- **Coverage.py**: Test coverage reporting
- **Docker**: Containerization
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code
- **AWS**: Cloud hosting platform

## Workflow Stages

### 1. Code Commit Stage

Triggered when:
- Code is pushed to any branch
- A pull request is opened or updated

Initial checks:
- Syntax validation
- Basic formatting checks
- Pre-commit hooks verification

### 2. Build Stage

Actions performed:
- Set up the Python environment
- Install dependencies
- Build the package
- Create Docker images (if applicable)

Example GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -e ".[dev]"
      - name: Build package
        run: python -m build
      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t abi:${{ github.sha }} .
```

### 3. Test Stage

Actions performed:
- Run unit tests
- Run integration tests
- Run end-to-end tests
- Generate test coverage reports

Example GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml

    needs: build
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -e ".[dev]"
      - name: Run unit tests
        run: pytest tests/unit
      - name: Run integration tests
        run: pytest tests/integration
      - name: Run e2e tests
        run: pytest tests/e2e
      - name: Generate coverage report
        run: |
          pytest --cov=src --cov-report=xml
          coverage report -m
      - name: Upload coverage report
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
        with:
          file: ./coverage.xml
```

### 4. Quality Checks Stage

Actions performed:
- Code linting with Flake8
- Code formatting with Black
- Type checking with Mypy
- Security scanning
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

Example GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml

  quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -e ".[dev]"
      - name: Run linting
        run: flake8 src tests
      - name: Check formatting
        run: black --check src tests
      - name: Type checking

## Branching Strategy

We follow a GitFlow-inspired branching strategy:

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for development
- `feature/*`: New features
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes
- `release/*`: Release candidates
- `hotfix/*`: Emergency fixes for production

```
        ┌────────┐
        │ hotfix │
        └───┬────┘
            │
┌───────┐   │   ┌────────┐    ┌─────────┐
│ main  │◄──┴───┤ release ├────┤ develop │
└───┬───┘       └────┬───┘    └────┬────┘
    │                │             │
    │                │        ┌────┴────┐
    │                │        │ feature │
    │                │        └─────────┘
    ▼                ▼             ▼
 Time →
```

## Release Process

1. **Create Release Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull
   git checkout -b release/v1.2.3
   ```

2. **Finalize Release**:
   - Fix any issues on the release branch
   - Update version numbers
   - Update documentation

3. **Merge to Main**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge --no-ff release/v1.2.3
   git tag v1.2.3
   git push origin main --tags
   ```

4. **Back-merge to Develop**:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git merge --no-ff release/v1.2.3
   git push origin develop
   ```

5. **Cleanup**:
   ```bash
   git branch -d release/v1.2.3
   ```

## Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR**: Backwards-compatible functionality
- **PATCH**: Backwards-compatible bug fixes

Example: `1.2.3`

## Continuous Monitoring

Post-deployment monitoring includes:

- **Performance Metrics**: Latency, throughput, error rates
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, disk, network
- **Error Tracking**: Exception monitoring
- **User Metrics**: Usage patterns, endpoint popularity

## Roll-Back Procedures

If issues are detected after deployment:

1. **Immediate Assessment**:
   - Determine severity and impact
   - Decide between fix-forward or rollback

2. **Rollback Process**:
   ```bash
   # For infrastructure
   terraform apply -var="environment=production" -var="version=v1.2.2"
   
   # For Docker deployments
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/abi-api
   
   # For serverless
   aws lambda update-function-code --function-name abi-function --s3-bucket deployments --s3-key v1.2.2/function.zip
   ```

3. **Post-Rollback Actions**:
   - Notify stakeholders
   - Root cause analysis
   - Document lessons learned

## Best Practices

1. **Fast Feedback**: Optimize the pipeline for speed
2. **Self-Testing**: Builds should verify their correctness
3. **Idempotency**: Deployments should be repeatable
4. **Infrastructure as Code**: Manage environments consistently
5. **Secure Secrets**: Never expose sensitive information
6. **Artifact Management**: Track and version all build artifacts
7. **Feature Flags**: Use for controlled feature rollout
8. **Blue/Green Deployments**: Minimize downtime and risk
9. **Canary Releases**: Test changes with a subset of users
10. **Documentation**: Keep deployment docs updated

## Troubleshooting CI/CD Issues

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Failed Tests**:
   - Check test logs for specific errors
   - Run tests locally with `pytest -vv`

2. **Build Failures**:
   - Verify dependencies are correctly specified
   - Check for environment-specific issues

3. **Deployment Failures**:
   - Validate infrastructure configuration
   - Check service health after deployment
   - Verify environment variables

4. **Performance Issues**:
   - Optimize test execution with parallelization
   - Use caching for dependencies and build artifacts
