## Resource Allocation Strategy

The project follows a gradual ramp-up of Forvis Mazars resources to facilitate knowledge transfer and capability building:

1. **Initial Phase** (March-May 2024):
   - Heavy reliance on NaasAI expertise
   - Limited Forvis Mazars involvement
   - Focus on knowledge transfer and foundation building

2. **Mid-Phase** (June-August 2024):
   - Increased Forvis Mazars involvement
   - Balanced contribution between teams
   - Focus on expanding capabilities and departments

3. **Advanced Phase** (September 2024-March 2025):
   - Significant Forvis Mazars involvement
   - Gradually shifting ownership to internal teams
   - Preparing for self-sufficient operation in Beta phase

This approach ensures sustainable knowledge transfer while maintaining development velocity throughout the project.

## Next Phase Planning

Upon successful completion of the Alpha phase in March 2025, the system will be prepared for:

1. **Beta Phase** (April-September 2025):
   - Expanded user base across all departments
   - Migration to hybrid infrastructure model
   - Focus on scalability and enterprise integration

2. **General Availability Phase** (October 2025 onwards):
   - Full production deployment
   - Commercialization for client projects
   - Continuous improvement and feature expansion
   - Long-term operational model

Each phase will have separate planning and timelines based on Alpha phase outcomes and organizational requirements.
