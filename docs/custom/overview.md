# BOB Project Overview

## Introduction

The BOB Project is an Agentic AI Management System (AMS) developed specifically for Forvis Mazars by leveraging the open-source ABI framework from NaasAI. Initiated in November 2024 with an experimental phase led by Jeremy Ravenel, Senior Advisor GenAI at Forvis Mazars and CEO of NaasAI, the project aims to transition from experimental to alpha phase over a 12-month period.

## Challenges

Forvis Mazars faces several challenges in a rapidly changing consulting environment:

1. **Information Fragmentation**: Market, client, and expertise data are scattered across multiple systems, making it difficult to achieve a unified view.

2. **Increasing Complexity**: The rapid evolution of technologies and client needs requires enhanced analytical and adaptive capabilities.

3. **Need for Automation**: Manual processes for market analysis, competitive intelligence, and building offerings documentation are time-consuming and not scalable.

4. **Organizational Silos**: The lack of knowledge sharing between teams limits operational efficiency.

5. **Closed-Source AI Systems**: The prevalence of closed-source enterprise AI platforms limits transparency and auditability in mission-critical business solutions.

## Objectives

The BOB project aims to:

1. **Unify Knowledge**: Create a centralized AI system integrating all relevant data sources.

2. **Automate Analysis**: Develop specialized AI agents for market analysis, competitive intelligence, production of client offerings, and client opportunity tracking.

3. **Enhance Collaboration**: Facilitate information and expertise sharing among teams.

4. **Accelerate Decision-Making**: Provide actionable insights in real-time to decision-makers.

## Opportunity

The timing is optimal for this project for several reasons:

1. **Technological Maturity**: Recent advances in AI have shown that while LLMs are powerful, they need to be combined with structured knowledge in the form of ontologies to create truly intelligent systems. This neuro-symbolic approach provides the robust foundation needed for enterprise AI.

2. **Market Demand**: The growing demand for data-driven and AI-based consulting services creates a unique positioning opportunity.

3. **Competitive Advantage**: By developing BOB now, Forvis Mazars can gain a significant lead in the use of explainable AI (XAI) for consulting and auditing.

4. **Commercial Potential**: Beyond internal use, BOB can become a differentiating commercial offering for Forvis Mazars' clients.

## Value Proposition

BOB streamlines and enhances Forvis Mazars' intelligence capabilities through three core modules:

### Market Intelligence Module

This module provides insights on any market player. Starting with an experimental approach in the "Data & AI Services" market ontology, it positions Forvis Mazars as a leader in data and AI services on the topic of XAI (Explainable AI) using ontologies to connect enterprise data with large language models (LLMs).

**Key Components:**
- Ontologies: Organization, People, Offering, Market
- Integrations: Websites, Google, Perplexity, ChatGPT, and other LLMs

### Offer Marketing Module

This module focuses on how Forvis Mazars presents its offerings online and offline. It standardizes Forvis Mazars' presentation, expertise, credentials (projects, achievements), and consultant profiles.

**Key Components:**
- Ontologies: Organization, Person, Offering, Market, Project, Task, Publication, Opportunity
- Integrations: Website, LinkedIn, and other social networks, as well as offer data stored on Teams, SharePoint, GitLab, and internal applications like Napta, Akuiteo, and Salesforce

### Business Development Module

This module creates a link between the previous two, allowing for tracking deals and monitoring signals during customer or prospect conversations. It facilitates the creation of automated proposals, Memo of Meetings, PowerPoint, Word, and Excel documents incorporating market intelligence insights and tailored service offerings.

**Key Components:**
- Ontologies: Organization, Person, Offering, Market, Project, Task, Publication, Opportunity, Asset
- Integrations: Salesforce, Akuiteo, Teams, SharePoint, GitLab, etc.

## Expected Impact

The BOB project will transform Forvis Mazars' market intelligence capabilities by:

- Improving consultant productivity with a 40-60% reduction in time spent on monitoring
- Enhancing the quality of analyses through automation and explainable AI
- Facilitating inter-team collaboration by breaking down data silos
- Strengthening strategic positioning in the emerging market of ontologies and SKGs
- Expanding the ability to serve large accounts through differentiating expertise
- Ensuring interoperability with client systems using the BFO standard

This transformation will position Forvis Mazars as a leader in the use of explainable AI technologies and ontologies while generating significant revenue through commercialization of the solution.
