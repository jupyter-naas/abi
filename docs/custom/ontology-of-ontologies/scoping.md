### **Scoping an Agent to Collect Open Web Ontologies**
We will design an **Ontology of Ontologies Agent** that systematically discovers, indexes, and structures publicly available ontologies from the web and other sources to feed into the Ontology of Ontologies Knowledge Graph. This agent will support use cases such as ontology alignment, AI model grounding, semantic search, and interoperability research.


## **Objectives**
- **Automate Ontology Discovery**: Crawl, extract, and categorize publicly available ontologies.
- **Standardize and Store Data**: Convert ontologies into a consistent format for easy integration.
- **Track Updates**: Monitor changes in existing ontologies for versioning.
- **Enable Semantic Search**: Index ontologies to allow structured querying and comparison.
- **Support Ontology Alignment**: Identify relationships between ontologies for interoperability.


## **Data Sources**
The agent will be on the lookout for ontologies from: 
- OBO Foundry (https://obofoundry.org/registry/ontologies.ttl)
- BioPortal (https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies)
- OntoHub (https://ontohub.org/ontologies)
- Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV) (https://lov.linkeddata.es/)
- Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/)
- arXiv (https://arxiv.org/)
- ResearchGate (https://www.researchgate.net/)
- W3C (https://www.w3.org/)

## **Integration, Pipeline, and Workflow Design**

### **Integration: Crawling & Discovery**  
- Utilize web scrapers and APIs to scan ontology sources.
- Extract structured (RDF, OWL, JSON-LD) and unstructured (PDFs, HTML, DOCX) ontology data.
- Implement keyword-based and graph-based discovery to expand the search.

### **Pipeline: Data Extraction & Standardization**  
- Parse ontologies from RDF, OWL, JSON-LD, XML, and Turtle formats.
- Convert into a unified format (e.g., RDF triples stored in a graph database).
- Extract key metadata (name, domain, creator, version, license).

### **Knowledge Graph: Semantic Indexing & Storage**  
- Create an **ontology index** for fast retrieval.
- Structure collected ontologies into a **knowledge graph** (linked to BFO and CCO).
- Enable cross-referencing based on class similarities, relationships, and domains.

### **Workflow: Update Monitoring & Version Control**  
- Track ontology updates through versioning in repositories.
- Detect schema modifications and deprecated concepts.

### **Workflow: Ontology Alignment & Comparison**  
- Compare classes, properties, and instances across ontologies.
- Suggest mappings and alignments for integration.
- Use embedding techniques for similarity scoring.



### **User Interface & API Access**  
- Provide a **GraphQL API** for querying collected ontologies.
- Develop a **semantic search engine** for ontology discovery.
- Enable visual exploration of ontology relationships.


## **Technical Stack**
- **Crawling & Scraping**: Scrapy, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Requests
- **Data Processing & Storage**: RDFLib, SPARQL
- **Embedding & Similarity**: OpenAI Embeddings, Sentence Transformers
- **Search & Indexing**: Elasticsearch, Whoosh
- **API & Frontend**: FastAPI, GraphQL, Streamlit
- **Visualization**: D3.js, Vega-Lite, Plotly
- **Ontology Development**: Naas, Protégé, rdflib
- **Data Processing & Storage**: RDFLib, SPARQL
  

## **Deployment**
- **Storage**: Naas AWS Private Cloud
- **Containerization**: Dockerized inside Naas ABI System
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

## **Use Cases**
- **AI System Grounding**: Provide structured knowledge to AI assistants.
- **Ontology Integration**: Align and merge ontologies for interoperability.
- **Research & Compliance**: Support regulatory and academic ontology exploration.
- **Semantic Web Applications**: Enhance linked data applications with structured ontologies.


### **Next Steps**
- [ ] Create a Prototype (POC): Initiate the process by gathering and indexing ontologies from a primary source (e.g., OBO Foundry, BioPortal).
- [ ] Establish an Ontology of Ontologies Module: Execute similarity analysis among the gathered ontologies.
- [ ] Construct API & Search Interface: Offer users structured access and search functionalities via API and Naas Platform.
- [ ] Broaden to Additional Sources: Enhance the system to crawl more repositories and academic databases.
