# Salesforce Integration Use Case

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the implementation of a Salesforce Integration within our system to centralize all opportunity and customer data management inside Salesforce. This integration will serve as the source of truth for opportunity tracking and provide a comprehensive view of customer relationships.

### 1.2 Background
Currently, opportunity tracking is managed outside of Salesforce (by Kevin), and there's a need to transfer this process to Salesforce. Additionally, there's a requirement to feed Salesforce with data from the Market Intelligence module.

### 1.3 Objectives
- Centralize all opportunity management within Salesforce
- Establish a standard operating procedure for managing opportunities in the system
- Create bidirectional data flow between our internal systems and Salesforce
- Leverage Salesforce's robust reporting and analytics capabilities
- Ensure all stakeholders have access to consistent, up-to-date information

## 2. Salesforce Data Model Understanding

### 2.1 Key Salesforce Objects
The Salesforce integration will primarily interact with the following standard objects:
- **Accounts**: Organizations/companies that are customers or potential customers
- **Contacts**: Individual people associated with accounts
- **Opportunities**: Potential sales or deals
- **Leads**: Potential customers before they're qualified
- **Tasks/Events**: Activities related to sales process
- **Campaigns**: Marketing initiatives

### 2.2 Custom Objects
Based on specific business requirements, we may need to create custom objects such as:
- **Market Intelligence Reports**: To store data from the Market Intelligence module
- **Opportunity Forecasts**: For advanced opportunity tracking
- **Industry Insights**: For domain-specific intelligence

### 2.3 Relationships
Understanding the relationships between these objects is crucial:
- Accounts have many Contacts (one-to-many)
- Accounts have many Opportunities (one-to-many)
- Contacts can be associated with multiple Opportunities (many-to-many)
- Leads can be converted to Accounts, Contacts, and Opportunities

## 3. Salesforce API Usage

### 3.1 Available APIs
Salesforce offers multiple APIs for integration:
- **REST API**: For most CRUD operations
- **SOAP API**: For complex operations and strict data typing
- **Bulk API**: For handling large data volumes
- **Streaming API**: For real-time updates
- **Composite API**: For executing multiple related operations in a single call

### 3.2 Authentication
Authentication will be implemented using OAuth 2.0 with JWT bearer flow, which provides secure, token-based access without storing passwords.

### 3.3 Rate Limits
Salesforce enforces API rate limits (typically 100,000 calls per 24 hours in Enterprise Edition). The integration needs to implement:
- Efficient batching of operations
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Monitoring of API usage

## 4. Standard Operating Procedure for Opportunity Management

### 4.1 Opportunity Creation
1. New opportunities can be created via:
   - Manual entry in Salesforce
   - API submission from our internal systems
   - Automated generation from qualified leads
2. Required fields for all opportunities:
   - Account
   - Opportunity name
   - Stage
   - Expected close date
   - Amount
   - Probability
   - Owner

### 4.2 Opportunity Tracking
1. All opportunities must follow a defined sales process with these stages:
   - Qualification
   - Needs Analysis
   - Value Proposition
   - Proposal/Price Quote
   - Negotiation/Review
   - Closed Won/Lost
2. Each stage transition requires:
   - Updated probability
   - Completion of required activities
   - Manager review (for certain thresholds)

### 4.3 Data Synchronization
1. Bi-directional sync between internal systems and Salesforce
2. Real-time updates for critical changes
3. Scheduled batch updates for non-critical data
4. Conflict resolution procedure when data is modified in multiple systems

## 5. Market Intelligence Integration

### 5.1 Data Flow
1. The Market Intelligence module will collect and analyze:
   - Industry trends
   - Competitor information
   - Market opportunities
   - Regulatory changes
2. This data will be processed and structured to match Salesforce's data model
3. Automated workflows will route intelligence to:
   - Account records for customer-specific intelligence
   - Opportunity records for deal-specific intelligence
   - Custom dashboards for executive visibility

### 5.2 Implementation Approach
1. Create custom objects in Salesforce to store market intelligence data
2. Implement scheduled jobs to process and upload intelligence reports
3. Develop triggers in Salesforce to notify relevant stakeholders
4. Create visualizations to make intelligence actionable

## 6. Transferring Opportunity Tracking from Kevin to Salesforce

### 6.1 Data Migration Strategy
1. **Analysis Phase**:
   - Inventory current opportunity tracking spreadsheets/tools
   - Map fields to Salesforce objects
   - Identify data quality issues
   - Define transformation rules

2. **Migration Phase**:
   - Extract data from current systems
   - Transform according to Salesforce requirements
   - Load data into staging environment
   - Validate data integrity
   - Final migration to production

3. **Post-Migration Phase**:
   - Parallel run period (2-4 weeks)
   - Training for Kevin and team
   - Gradual decommissioning of old system

### 6.2 Process Changes
1. Document workflow changes for all stakeholders
2. Establish new approval chains within Salesforce
3. Create role-specific views and reports
4. Implement automated notifications for key events

## 7. Technical Implementation

### 7.1 Integration Implementation
- Develop `SalesforceIntegration` class that inherits from the base `Integration` class
- Implement authentication, rate limiting, and error handling
- Build CRUD operations for all relevant Salesforce objects

### 7.2 Pipeline Implementation
- Create data transformation pipelines to convert internal data models to Salesforce objects
- Implement validation rules to ensure data quality
- Build bidirectional synchronization capabilities

### 7.3 Workflow Implementation
- Develop workflows for opportunity management
- Create automated processes for market intelligence distribution
- Implement reporting and analytics workflows

## 8. Success Metrics

### 8.1 Technical Metrics
- API call efficiency (calls per operation)
- Synchronization reliability (% of successful syncs)
- System performance impact

### 8.2 Business Metrics
- Adoption rate among users
- Time saved in opportunity management
- Improved data quality (reduction in duplicates, missing fields)
- Enhanced reporting capabilities

## 9. Implementation Timeline
