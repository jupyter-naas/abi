# BOB Project: Agentic AI Management System for Forvis Mazars

## Overview

BOB is a customized version of the ABI framework specifically tailored for Forvis Mazars. This Agentic AI Management System (AMS) leverages ontology-based knowledge graphs (also known as semantic knowledge graphs or SKGs) using Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as a Top Level Ontology (TLO) to transform Forvis Mazars' consulting and auditing capabilities.

The system aims to create a digital twin that captures and operationalizes Forvis Mazars' collective expertise and market understanding, initially focusing on:

- Providing near real-time market intelligence
- Supporting the marketing of service offerings
- Identifying emerging business development signals
