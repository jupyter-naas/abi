# BOB Project Methodology

The BOB project implementation follows a dual-track approach focusing on both user experience and developer workflow to ensure rapid iteration and continuous improvement.

## User Experience Journey

The BOB interface serves as the primary point of interaction for all users within Forvis Mazars. The system is designed to create a seamless, intuitive experience that delivers immediate value while continuously learning from user interactions.

### Interaction Model

When users engage with BOB, they are connected to the appropriate AI assistant based on their needs:

1. **Conversation Initiation**: Users start by describing their needs in natural language
2. **Intent Recognition**: The system identifies the appropriate module (Market Intelligence, Offer Marketing, or Business Development)
3. **Contextual Dialogue**: BOB maintains conversation context, allowing for natural follow-up questions
4. **Knowledge Graph Access**: The system queries and updates the semantic knowledge graph in real-time
5. **Content Generation**: Responses are formatted appropriately, from simple text to complex documents
6. **Action Execution**: Where needed, BOB can trigger workflows and integrations with other systems

### Feedback Loop

Each interaction with BOB contributes to the system's growth through multiple feedback mechanisms:

- **Explicit Feedback**: Thumbs up/down ratings, comments, and direct suggestions
- **Implicit Signals**: Query patterns, conversation flows, and interaction metrics
- **Automatic Issue Generation**: When BOB cannot provide satisfactory answers, the system automatically generates GitHub issues for the development team
- **User Interviews**: Regular sessions with key users to gather qualitative feedback

### User Roles & Adaptations

The interface adapts to different user roles and contexts:

- **Associates & Partners**: Focus on business development and client insights
- **Market Analysts**: Deep dive capabilities for competitive intelligence
- **Service Delivery Teams**: Access to credentials and offering details
- **Business Development Professionals**: Proposal generation and opportunity tracking
- **Administrators**: System configuration and ontology management

### Privacy & Security

All interactions are designed with privacy and security in mind:

- **Role-Based Access**: Users only see information appropriate to their role
- **Audit Trails**: All queries and responses are logged for compliance
- **Confidentiality Controls**: Sensitive client information is protected
- **GDPR Compliance**: Personal data handling follows regulatory requirements

## Developer Workflow and Delivery Process

The development team operates on a streamlined GitHub-based workflow that emphasizes transparency, collaboration, and continuous deployment.

### Backlog Management

The development backlog is continuously populated from two primary sources:

1. **Automated Generation**: Issues created automatically from user interactions with BOB
2. **Manual Creation**: Business requirements and technical needs identified by the team

This backlog forms the foundation of weekly project roadmap meetings, where the entire team reviews, prioritizes, and estimates work items.

### Issue Tracking and Time Management

All development work is managed through GitHub issues with a standardized approach:

1. **Issue Creation**: Each task is documented as a GitHub issue with clear acceptance criteria
2. **Estimation**: All issues are estimated in hours during planning meetings (see [Time Tracking & Estimation](time-tracking.md))
3. **Assignment**: Issues are assigned to team members based on expertise and availability
4. **Progress Tracking**: Team members update issues with progress comments and time spent
5. **Review Process**: Completed work undergoes peer review before being marked as resolved

Team members are required to log time spent on each issue directly in GitHub using standardized time tracking commands. This data is essential for project visibility, resource allocation, and improving future estimates.

### Collaborative Development Model

Tasks are distributed based on expertise and availability rather than rigid team boundaries:

- **NaasAI Components**: Core framework elements maintained by NaasAI
- **Collaborative Components**: Joint development between NaasAI and Forvis Mazars
- **Forvis Mazars Ownership**: Business logic and domain-specific elements

### Development Cycle

The project follows a three-month iterative cycle for major releases:

1. **Planning Phase** (2 weeks):
   - Prioritization of features
   - Technical design sessions
   - Acceptance criteria definition

2. **Development Phase** (8 weeks):
   - Weekly sprints with defined deliverables
   - Continuous integration and testing
   - Regular demos to stakeholders

3. **Integration Phase** (2 weeks):
   - End-to-end testing across modules
   - Performance optimization
   - Documentation updates

### Release Process

Each release cycle concludes with:

1. **Internal Keynote**: In-person gathering of the taskforce to showcase new features
2. **Release Notes**: Detailed documentation of changes and improvements
3. **User Training**: Sessions to introduce new capabilities to key users
4. **Feedback Collection**: Structured process to gather initial reactions

### Governance Structure

Project oversight is maintained through multiple mechanisms:

1. **Weekly Development Standups**: Tactical coordination among the development team
2. **Bi-Weekly Product Reviews**: Feature demonstrations and feedback collection
3. **Monthly Strategic Meetings**: Sessions with project sponsors to review progress and adjust priorities
4. **Quarterly Business Reviews**: Evaluation of business impact and strategic alignment

## Implementation Principles

The BOB project adheres to several key principles throughout implementation:

### Value-First Approach

- Every feature must demonstrate clear business value
- Rapid prototyping to validate assumptions before full implementation
- Regular measurement of impact against success metrics

### Open Source Foundation

- Building on ABI's open-source core
- Contributing improvements back to the community
- Maintaining clear separation between open core and proprietary extensions

### Knowledge Transfer

- Paired programming between NaasAI and Forvis Mazars developers
- Comprehensive documentation of all components
- Regular learning sessions on key technologies and concepts

### Quality Assurance

- Automated testing for all components
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Performance benchmarking against established baselines

### Continuous Optimization

- Usage analytics to identify improvement opportunities
- Regular refactoring sessions to manage technical debt
- Performance optimization based on actual usage patterns

This methodology creates a virtuous cycle where user feedback directly influences development priorities, and development outputs are quickly validated through real-world usage. The result is a continuously evolving platform that remains closely aligned with user needs while maintaining high technical standards and strategic relevance.
