## Prerequisites

Before installing ABI, ensure you have:

- **[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)** - Required for Oxigraph triple store
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)** - Python package manager
- **Python 3.11+** - For running ABI components
- **Git** - For cloning repositories

## Installation Options

Choose the approach that best fits your needs:

### 1. Clone Repository (Recommended)
Best for: Exploring ABI and following tutorials

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jupyter-naas/abi.git
cd abi
```

### 2. Fork Repository
Best for: Contributing back to the project

```bash
# 1. Fork via GitHub UI: https://github.com/jupyter-naas/abi/fork
# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/abi.git
cd abi
```

### 3. Private Fork
Best for: Private customization with upstream sync

```bash
# 1. Create private repository via GitHub UI
# 2. Clone your private repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/abi-private.git
cd abi-private

# 3. Add upstream for updates
git remote add upstream https://github.com/jupyter-naas/abi.git
git pull --rebase upstream main
git push
```

## Environment Setup

### 1. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your preferred editor and configure at least one AI model provider:

```bash
# OpenAI (recommended for getting started)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key

# Anthropic Claude
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key

# Google Gemini  
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key

# Mistral
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-mistral-api-key
```

**Note:** The .env file should never be committed to version control as it contains sensitive credentials.

### 2. Configure AI Network

ABI's revolutionary approach uses a single `config.yaml` file to define your entire AI Network. This configuration-driven architecture eliminates hardcoded agents and enables instant modifications. The main sections include:

**System Configuration:**
- `workspace_id`: Naas Platform workspace ID for storage and publishing
- `github_project_repository`: Your GitHub repository (e.g. "jupyter-naas/abi")
- `api_title`: API title displayed in documentation
- `storage_name` and `space_name`: Storage configuration

**AI Network Configuration:**
The `ai_network` section is where the magic happens - define all your agents using SLUG-based identifiers with instant enable/disable capability:

```yaml
ai_network:
  # ABI Orchestrator with centralized intent mapping
  abi:
    enabled: true
    description: "Multi-agent orchestrator"
    strengths: "Orchestration, strategic advisory"
    use_when: "Identity, strategy, coordination"
    intent_mapping:
      raw_intents:
        "what is your name": "My name is ABI"
        "who are you": "I am ABI, developed by NaasAI"
      tool_intents:
        open_knowledge_graph_explorer:
          - "show knowledge graph"
          - "sparql query"
        check_ai_network_config:
          - "list agents"
          - "agent status"
      agent_intents:
        chatgpt:
          - "use chatgpt"
          - "web search"
        claude:
          - "use claude"
          - "anthropic"

  # Foundation AI Models
  chatgpt:
    enabled: true
    description: "OpenAI ChatGPT"
    strengths: "General conversation, coding"
    use_when: "General tasks, coding help"

  claude:
    enabled: true
    description: "Anthropic Claude"
    strengths: "Analysis, writing"
    use_when: "Detailed analysis"

  # Disabled agents (ready for activation)
  llama:
    enabled: false
    description: "Meta Llama"
    strengths: "Local, private"
    use_when: "Private tasks"
```

## Revolutionary Configuration-Driven Architecture

ABI's breakthrough configuration system transforms how AI Networks are built and managed:

- **Single Source of Truth**: Your entire AI Network defined in one config.yaml file
- **SLUG-Based Routing**: Consistent agent identification and routing system
- **Enhanced Intent Mapping**: Revolutionary support for RAW, TOOL, and AGENT intent types
- **Instant Agent Control**: Enable/disable agents with a single config change
- **Zero Code Modifications**: All behavior changes through configuration only
- **Complete Flexibility**: Add new agents and intents without touching code

### Agent Definition Structure

Each agent contains:
- **enabled**: Boolean flag for activation
- **description**: Brief agent description
- **strengths**: Core capabilities
- **use_when**: Recommended use cases

### ABI Intent Mapping Types

The ABI agent contains centralized intent mapping with three types:
- **raw_intents**: Direct text responses (key-value pairs)
- **tool_intents**: Route to specific tools/functions
- **agent_intents**: Route to specific agents

**Revolutionary Benefits:**
- **Instant Agent Control**: Simply change `enabled: true/false` to activate/deactivate any agent
- **Zero Code Modifications**: All agent behavior and intent routing controlled through config.yaml
- **SLUG-Based Routing**: Consistent agent identification across your entire AI Network
- **Dynamic Intent Mapping**: Add new intents and behaviors without touching a single line of code

## Quick Start

### Start Your First Agent

Once configured, start chatting with the core ABI agent:

```bash
make chat-abi-agent
```

This command will:
1. Set up the environment and install Python dependencies
2. Start Docker services (Oxigraph triple store)
3. Initialize the knowledge graph with base ontologies
4. Launch the interactive agent in your terminal

The first run may take a few minutes as it downloads and starts the Oxigraph Docker container.

### Expected Output

You should see something like:

```
üöÄ Starting ABI Agent...
üê≥ Starting Oxigraph triple store...
üß† Initializing knowledge graph...
üí¨ ABI Agent ready! Type your message below:

ABI Agent: Hello! I'm your ABI agent. I can help you with:
- Building custom AI agents
- Managing ontologies and knowledge graphs  
- Creating integrations with external services
- Developing workflows and pipelines

What would you like to work on today?

You: 
```

## Verification

### Test Core Functionality

Try these commands to verify your installation:

```bash
# Test agent interaction
echo "What agents are available?" | make chat-abi-agent-prompt

# Test API server (in another terminal)
make api
# Then visit http://localhost:8000/docs

# Check services are running
docker ps
```

You should see the Oxigraph container running on port 7878.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Docker not running?**
```bash
# Start Docker Desktop and verify
docker --version
docker ps
```

**Python dependencies failing?**
```bash
# Ensure uv is installed and updated
uv --version
uv self update

# Clean and reinstall
rm -rf .venv
make setup
```

**Oxigraph connection errors?**
```bash
# Check if container is running
docker ps | grep oxigraph

# Restart if needed
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d oxigraph
```

**Agent not responding?**
```bash
# Check environment variables
cat .env | grep API_KEY

# Verify API key validity
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
     https://api.openai.com/v1/models
```
