# Creating Assistants

This guide walks you through the process of creating custom assistants in the ABI framework, from conceptualization to implementation and deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before creating an assistant, you should have:

- A working ABI installation
- Basic understanding of the [ABI architecture](../concepts/architecture.md)
- Familiarity with the [assistant concept](../concepts/assistants.md)
- Python knowledge and LangChain experience

## Steps to Create an Assistant

### 1. Define the Purpose and Capabilities

First, clearly define what your assistant should accomplish:

- What business domain will it operate in?
- What user questions should it answer?
- What actions should it be able to perform?
- What data sources will it need access to?

### 2. Plan the Assistant Components

Identify the components your assistant will need:

- **Workflows**: What business processes will it orchestrate?
- **Tools**: What specific operations should it be able to perform?
- **Knowledge Sources**: What ontologies or databases will it query?
- **Response Templates**: How should it format responses?

### 3. Configure the Assistant

Create the assistant configuration:

```python
from abi.assistant import Assistant, AssistantConfiguration
from abi.tools import ToolRegistry

# Define assistant configuration
config = AssistantConfiguration(
    name="CustomerSupportAssistant",
    description="Provides customer support for our products",
    model="gpt-4",  # LLM model to use
    temperature=0.2,  # Lower for more deterministic responses
    system_message="""You are a helpful customer support assistant.
        Provide clear, accurate information about our products.
        For technical issues, guide users through troubleshooting steps.
        For billing questions, direct users to appropriate resources.
        Always maintain a professional, helpful tone."""
)
```

### 4. Register Tools

Register the tools your assistant will use:

```python
# Create tool registry
tools = ToolRegistry()

# Register workflow tools
support_workflow = SupportTicketWorkflow(support_workflow_config)
knowledge_workflow = ProductKnowledgeWorkflow(knowledge_workflow_config)

# Add tools to the registry
tools.register_tools(support_workflow.as_tools())
tools.register_tools(knowledge_workflow.as_tools())

# Register utility tools
tools.register(search_documentation_tool)
tools.register(get_product_details_tool)
tools.register(check_order_status_tool)
```

### 5. Implement the Assistant

Create the assistant instance:

```python
# Initialize the assistant
customer_support_assistant = Assistant(config, tools)

# Add assistant to assistant registry
from abi.assistant import AssistantRegistry
registry = AssistantRegistry()
registry.register("customer_support", customer_support_assistant)
```

### 6. Create Custom Tools (if needed)

Implement any custom tools specific to your assistant:

```python
from abi.tools import Tool
from typing import Dict

def search_documentation(query: str) -> Dict:
    """Search product documentation for relevant information.
    
    Args:
        query: The search query
        
    Returns:
        Dict containing search results
    """
    # Implementation details
    # ...
    return results

# Create a tool from the function
search_documentation_tool = Tool(
    name="search_documentation",
    description="Search product documentation for relevant information",
    function=search_documentation
)
```

### 7. Define Memory and Context Management

Configure how the assistant maintains conversation context:

```python
from abi.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

# Create memory instance
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(
    return_messages=True,
    memory_key="chat_history",
    output_key="output"
)

# Attach to assistant
assistant.set_memory(memory)
```

### 8. Test the Assistant

Test your assistant with sample queries:

```python
# Basic tests
test_questions = [
    "Can you tell me about the warranty for the XYZ product?",
    "I'm having trouble connecting my device to WiFi",
    "What's the status of my recent order?",
    "How do I return a damaged product?"
]

# Run tests
for question in test_questions:
    response = customer_support_assistant.process_message(question)
    print(f"Q: {question}")
    print(f"A: {response}")
    print("-" * 80)
```

### 9. Evaluate and Refine

Evaluate the assistant's performance:

- Does it correctly understand user intents?
- Are its responses accurate and helpful?
- Does it correctly use the available tools?
- Is additional context or knowledge needed?

Based on evaluation, refine the assistant by:
- Updating the system message
- Adding more tools
- Improving response templates
- Fine-tuning parameters

### 10. Deploy the Assistant

Make the assistant available through desired interfaces:

```python
# API Endpoint
from fastapi import APIRouter
router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/assistant/customer-support")
async def process_message(message: str):
    """Process a message through the customer support assistant."""
    return customer_support_assistant.process_message(message)

# Add router to main app
app.include_router(router, prefix="/api/v1")
```

## Advanced Assistant Features

### Multi-modal Assistants

For assistants that handle images or other media:

```python
# Configure multi-modal capabilities
config = AssistantConfiguration(
    name="VisualSupportAssistant",
    description="Provides support with image analysis",
    model="gpt-4-vision",  # Vision-capable model
    modalities=["text", "image"]
)

# Add image processing tools
tools.register(analyze_product_image_tool)
tools.register(identify_product_tool)
```

### Proactive Assistants

Create assistants that can take initiative:

```python
# Alert workflow
alert_workflow = AlertWorkflow(alert_workflow_config)

# Register proactive tools
tools.register_tools(alert_workflow.as_tools())

# Schedule regular checks
@scheduler.scheduled_job("cron", hour="*/3")
def check_alerts():
    """Check for conditions that require proactive alerts."""
    issues = alert_workflow.check_for_issues()
    if issues:
        for user_id, issue_list in issues.items():
            for issue in issue_list:
                assistant.send_proactive_message(
                    user_id=user_id,
                    message=f"Alert: {issue['description']}",
                    data=issue
                )
```

### Domain-Specialized Assistants

Specialize assistants for particular domains:

```python
# Finance domain assistant
finance_assistant_config = AssistantConfiguration(
    name="FinanceAnalyst",
    description="Specialized financial analysis assistant",
    model="gpt-4",
    domain_knowledge=["finance", "accounting", "taxation"],
    system_message="""You are a financial analyst assistant...
    """
)

# Register domain-specific ontologies
finance_assistant.register_ontology("finance_ontology")
finance_assistant.register_ontology("accounting_ontology")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep System Messages Clear**: Write clear, specific system messages to guide assistant behavior
2. **Use Appropriate Temperature**: Lower for factual tasks, higher for creative tasks
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Test with a wide range of queries, including edge cases
4. **Monitor and Improve**: Continuously monitor performance and user feedback
5. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Ensure tools have proper error handling
6. **Maintain Context**: Design memory systems to maintain relevant context
7. **Document Thoroughly**: Document assistant capabilities and limitations

## Troubleshooting

### Assistant Not Using Tools

If your assistant isn't using the provided tools:
- Check tool descriptions for clarity
- Ensure system message mentions available tools
- Verify tools are properly registered

### Poor Response Quality

If responses aren't helpful:
- Review and improve system message
- Adjust temperature parameter
- Add more specific guidance on response format
- Enhance the available tools

### Context Management Issues

If the assistant loses context:
- Increase memory buffer size
- Implement summarization for long conversations
- Use more sophisticated memory types
