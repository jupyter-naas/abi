> A multi-agent AI System that uses ontologies to unify data, AI models, and workflows. 
‚≠ê **Star and follow to stay updated!**

## Overview

**ABI** (Agentic Brain Infrastructure) is an AI Operating System that uses intent-driven routing to match user requests with pre-configured responses and actions. When you make a request, ABI identifies your intent and triggers the appropriate response - whether that's a direct answer, tool usage, or routing to a specific AI agent.

The system combines multiple AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Llama, Mistral) with a semantic knowledge graph to map intents to actions, enabling intelligent routing based on what you're trying to accomplish.

## How ABI Works

**ABI is an AI Operating System** that orchestrates intelligent agents, data systems, and workflows through semantic understanding and automated reasoning.

### üîÑ **Four-Layer Architecture**

**1. User Interaction Layer**
- **Multiple Interfaces**: Chat, REST API, Web Dashboard, MCP Protocol (Claude Desktop integration)
- **Universal Access**: Single entry point to all AI capabilities and domain expertise

**2. Agent Orchestration Layer** using LangGraph agents
- **ABI SuperAssistant**: Central coordinator that analyzes requests and routes to optimal resources
- **AI Model Agents**: Access to ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Llama, Mistral, and local models
- **Domains Expert Agents**: 20+ specialized agents (Software Engineer, Data Analyst, Content Creator, etc.)
- **Applications Expert Agents**: 20+ specialized agents (GitHub, Google, LinkedIn, Powerpoint, etc.)

**3. Adaptive Storage Layer** based on Hexagonal architecture
- **Semantic Knowledge Graph**: RDF triples in BFO-compliant ontologies for reasoning and relationships (default: Oxygraph)
- **Vector Database**: Intent embeddings for semantic similarity matching and context understanding (default: Qdrant)
- **Memory System**: For conversation history and persistent context (default: PostgresSQL)
- **File Storage**: Generated reports, documents, and workflow outputs (default: AWS S3)

**4. Execution Components Layer**
- **Ontologies**: BFO-structured knowledge that defines how data relates and flows
- **Pipelines**: Automated data processing that transforms raw information into semantic knowledge
- **Workflows**: Business process automation triggered by user requests or system events
- **Integrations**: Connections to external APIs, databases, and applications
- **Analytics**: Real-time dashboards and reporting capabilities

### ‚ö° **Intelligent Request Flow**

1. **Request Analysis**: ABI receives your request through any interface
2. **Semantic Understanding**: Vector search and SPARQL queries identify intent and context
3. **Agent Routing**: Knowledge graph determines the best agent/model combination
4. **Resource Coordination**: Agents access ontologies, trigger workflows, and use integrations as needed
5. **Knowledge Creation**: Results are stored back into the knowledge graph for future reasoning
6. **Kinetic Actions**: System automatically triggers related processes and workflows based on new knowledge

## Why ABI?

**Ontology-Based AI to Preserve the Freedom to Reason**: The convergence of semantic alignment and kinetic action through ontology-driven systems represents one of the most powerful technologies ever created. When such transformative capabilities exist behind closed doors or within a single organization's control, it threatens the fundamental freedom to reason and act independently. We believe this power should be distributed, not concentrated - because the ability to understand, reason about, and act upon complex information is a cornerstone of human autonomy and democratic society.

**Core Capabilities for the Innovation Community:**
- **Ontology-Driven Intelligence**: Semantic understanding that connects data, meaning, and action
- **Knowledge Graph Operations**: Real-time reasoning over complex, interconnected information
- **Automated Decision Systems**: AI that understands context and triggers appropriate responses
- **Semantic Data Integration**: Connect disparate systems through shared understanding, not just APIs

**The Open Source Advantage:**
- **Research & Education**: Academic institutions and researchers can explore ontological AI without barriers
- **Innovation Acceleration**: Developers can build upon proven semantic architectures
- **Community Collaboration**: Collective advancement of ontology-based AI methodologies
- **Accessible Entry Point**: Learn and experiment with enterprise-grade semantic technologies

Moreover, this project is built with international standards and regulatory frameworks as guiding principles, including [ISO/IEC 42001:2023 (AI Management Systems)](https://www.iso.org/standard/42001), [ISO/IEC 21838-2:2021 (Basic Formal Ontology)](https://www.iso.org/standard/74572.html), and forward-compatibility with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act, ABI provides a customizable framework suitable for individuals and organizations aiming to create intelligent, automated systems aligned to their needs.

## Who is this for?
