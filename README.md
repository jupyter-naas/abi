> A multi-agent AI System that uses ontologies to unify data, AI models, and workflows. 
‚≠ê **Star and follow to stay updated!**

## Overview

**ABI** (Agentic Brain Infrastructure) is an AI Operating System that uses intent-driven routing to match user requests with pre-configured responses and actions. When you make a request, ABI identifies your intent and triggers the appropriate response - whether that's a direct answer, tool usage, or routing to a specific AI agent.

The system combines multiple AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Llama, Mistral) with a semantic knowledge graph to map intents to actions, enabling intelligent routing based on what you're trying to accomplish.

## How ABI Works

**ABI is your intelligent AI SuperAssistant** that connects you to the right tools and expertise for any task.

**What ABI Does:**
- **Smart Routing**: Automatically picks the best AI model (ChatGPT, Claude, local models) based on your specific needs
- **Context Memory**: Remembers your ongoing conversations so you never have to repeat yourself
- **Expert Access**: Connects you to 20+ domain expert agents (Software Engineer, Content Creator, Data Analyst, etc.)
- **Workflow Automation**: Triggers business processes and data pipelines based on your requests
- **Multi-Interface**: Works through chat, API, web dashboard, or integrates with Claude Desktop

**Simple Process**: Ask ABI anything ‚Üí It analyzes your request ‚Üí Routes to the best agent/tool ‚Üí Delivers complete results

**Technical Foundation**: 
- **Oxigraph**: Semantic knowledge graph with 50,000+ RDF triples in BFO-compliant ontologies
- **Vector Database**: Stores intent embeddings for semantic similarity matching
- **SPARQL + Vector Search**: Combines structured queries with semantic similarity for accurate intent matching
- **Ontologies (BFO Top-Level)**: Provide classes, properties, relations, and logic for pipelines to accurately model reality
- **External Integrations**: Connect to APIs, systems, databases, tools, and applications
- **Object Storage**: Agents, workflows, and pipelines can generate files (reports, documents, etc.) 

Built with international standards and regulatory frameworks as guiding principles, including [ISO/IEC 42001:2023 (AI Management Systems)](https://www.iso.org/standard/42001), [ISO/IEC 21838-2:2021 (Basic Formal Ontology)](https://www.iso.org/standard/74572.html), and forward-compatibility with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act, ABI provides a customizable framework suitable for individuals and organizations aiming to create intelligent, automated systems aligned to their needs.

## Why ABI?

**Ontology-Based AI to Preserve the Freedom to Reason**: The convergence of semantic alignment and kinetic action through ontology-driven systems represents one of the most powerful technologies ever created. When such transformative capabilities exist behind closed doors or within a single organization's control, it threatens the fundamental freedom to reason and act independently. We believe this power should be distributed, not concentrated - because the ability to understand, reason about, and act upon complex information is a cornerstone of human autonomy and democratic society.

**Core Capabilities for the Innovation Community:**
- **Ontology-Driven Intelligence**: Semantic understanding that connects data, meaning, and action
- **Knowledge Graph Operations**: Real-time reasoning over complex, interconnected information
- **Automated Decision Systems**: AI that understands context and triggers appropriate responses
- **Semantic Data Integration**: Connect disparate systems through shared understanding, not just APIs

**The Open Source Advantage:**
- **Research & Education**: Academic institutions and researchers can explore ontological AI without barriers
- **Innovation Acceleration**: Developers can build upon proven semantic architectures
- **Community Collaboration**: Collective advancement of ontology-based AI methodologies
- **Accessible Entry Point**: Learn and experiment with enterprise-grade semantic technologies

## Who is this for?
