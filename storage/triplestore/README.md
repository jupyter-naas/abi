# Triplestore

This directory is used to store RDF triples generated by ABI pipelines.

## Purpose

The triplestore contains semantic knowledge represented as RDF triples (subject-predicate-object). This includes:
- Knowledge graphs derived from processed data
- Semantic relationships between entities
- Ontology definitions and instances
- Query-ready semantic data
- Inference-ready knowledge bases

## Best Practices

1. Organize triples in subdirectories by:
   - Domain/subject area
   - Project/application
   - Ontology version
   - Data source

2. Use clear naming conventions:
   - Include ontology version in filenames
   - Use descriptive prefixes for knowledge domains
   - Maintain consistent naming for related graph files

3. Knowledge Management:
   - Document the ontologies used
   - Maintain provenance information
   - Consider graph partitioning for large knowledge bases
   - Implement versioning for evolving knowledge

4. Performance Considerations:
   - Monitor triple count for performance impacts
   - Consider specialized triple stores for large-scale deployment
   - Document SPARQL query patterns
   - Optimize frequent queries

## Important Notes

- Large triple stores may impact query performance
- Consider graph database solutions for production environments
- RDF data should follow consistent ontological models
- Document ontology dependencies
- All data is synced with your Naas workspace storage

The ABI system includes other specialized storage mechanisms:
- **Datastore**: For raw data files and general-purpose storage
- **Vectorstore**: For AI vector embeddings and similarity search
