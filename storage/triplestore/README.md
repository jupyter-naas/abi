# Triple Store

This directory is used to store RDF triples generated by ABI pipelines.

## Purpose

The triple store contains semantic data in RDF format that represents:
- Pipeline processing results
- Knowledge graphs
- Ontology data
- Semantic relationships
- Inferred data

## Best Practices

1. Organization:
   - Use clear naming conventions for files
   - Group related triples in separate files
   - Maintain consistent formatting
   - Document complex relationships

2. File Management:
   - Use .ttl extension for Turtle format files
   - Include version information when relevant
   - Back up important triple stores
   - Clean up obsolete data regularly

3. Data Quality:
   - Validate triples before storing
   - Check for consistency
   - Document any assumptions
   - Maintain ontology alignment

## Important Notes

- Triple stores are automatically managed by pipelines
- Manual edits should be done carefully
- Large triple stores may impact query performance
- All data is synced with your Naas workspace storage
