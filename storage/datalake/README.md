# Data Lake

This directory is used to store data for automation purposes in the ABI system.

## Purpose

The data lake stores raw and processed data used in various automation workflows and pipelines. This includes:
- Raw data files from integrations
- Intermediate processing results
- Cached data for performance optimization
- Training data for machine learning models
- Output data from automated processes

## Best Practices

1. Organize data in subdirectories by:
   - Data source/integration
   - Project/workflow
   - Data type
   - Processing stage (raw, processed, final)

2. Use clear naming conventions:
   - Include timestamps in filenames when relevant
   - Use descriptive prefixes/suffixes
   - Maintain consistent naming patterns

3. Data Management:
   - Regularly clean up obsolete or temporary data
   - Document data formats and schemas
   - Monitor storage usage
   - Implement data retention policies

4. Version Control:
   - Track data versions when appropriate
   - Document data transformations
   - Maintain changelog for significant updates

## Important Notes

- Large datasets may impact storage synchronization time
- Consider compression for large files
- Sensitive data should be properly secured
- All data is synced with your Naas workspace storage
