# ABI Storage Directory

This directory serves as the central storage location for your ABI system. It is automatically synchronized with your Naas Workspace storage under the "abi" directory.

## Directory Structure

The storage directory contains various specialized subdirectories, each optimized for different storage needs:

### Datastore
- Stores raw and processed data for automation purposes
- Includes data from integrations, intermediate processing results, and cached data
- Organized as files in various formats (JSON, CSV, Excel, etc.)
- Best for general-purpose file storage

### Triplestore
- Stores RDF triples (subject-predicate-object) generated by ABI pipelines
- Contains semantic knowledge in graph format
- Primarily uses Turtle files (*.ttl) and other semantic formats
- Best for knowledge representation and semantic relationships

### Vectorstore
- Stores vector embeddings for AI applications
- Used for semantic search and similarity operations
- Includes text and multimodal embeddings with associated metadata
- Best for machine learning applications and retrieval augmented generation

## How to Use

### Storage Synchronization Commands
To manage your storage synchronization, use the following commands from the root directory:

```bash
make storage-pull   # Pull data from S3 storage to local data directory
make storage-push   # Push local data to S3 storage
```

These commands help you:
- `storage-pull`: Download the latest version of your files from S3 storage
- `storage-push`: Upload your local changes to S3 storage

Best practices:
1. Pull before starting work to ensure you have the latest files
2. Push after making significant changes to backup your work
3. Always push before ending your session to ensure all changes are saved

## Usage

1. Use the appropriate storage type based on your data needs:
   - Datastore for general files and raw data
   - Triplestore for semantic knowledge and relationships
   - Vectorstore for AI embeddings and similarity search
2. Place documents for analysis in the documents directory
3. All files are automatically synchronized with your Naas Workspace Storage 

## Important Notes

- Keep directories organized to maintain system performance
- Large files may take longer to sync
- Ensure you have sufficient storage space in your Naas Workspace
- Do not delete system-generated files unless instructed to do so

## Synchronization

Files in this directory are automatically synchronized with your Naas Workspace storage under the "abi" directory. This ensures:
- Data persistence across sessions
- Backup of important files
- Access to your data from different environments
