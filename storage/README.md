# ABI Storage Directory

This directory serves as the central storage location for your ABI system. It is automatically synchronized with your Naas Workspace storage under the "abi" directory.

## Directory Structure

The storage directory contains various types of files and data used by the ABI system:

### Documents
- PDF files (*.pdf)
- Microsoft Word documents (*.docx)
- Microsoft PowerPoint presentations (*.ppt, *.pptx)
- Microsoft Excel spreadsheets (*.xls, *.xlsx)
- Images (*.jpg, *.png, *.gif, etc.)

### Data Lake
- Stores raw and processed data for automation purposes
- Includes data from integrations, intermediate processing results, cached data, training data, and output data

### Triple Store
- Stores RDF triples generated by ABI pipelines
- Turtle files (*.ttl) 
- Contains RDF data in Turtle format
- Other semantic web formats (*.rdf, *.owl, etc.)

## How to Use

### Storage Synchronization Commands
To manage your storage synchronization, use the following commands from the root directory:

```bash
make storage-pull   # Pull data from S3 storage to local data directory
make storage-push   # Push local data to S3 storage
```

These commands help you:
- `storage-pull`: Download the latest version of your files from S3 storage
- `storage-push`: Upload your local changes to S3 storage

Best practices:
1. Pull before starting work to ensure you have the latest files
2. Push after making significant changes to backup your work
3. Always push before ending your session to ensure all changes are saved

## Usage

1. Place any documents you want to analyze or process with the ABI system in this directory
2. Ontology store files are automatically managed by the system
3. All files are automatically synchronized with your Naas Workspace Storage 

## Important Notes

- Keep this directory organized to maintain system performance
- Large files may take longer to sync
- Ensure you have sufficient storage space in your Naas Workspace
- Do not delete system-generated ontology files unless instructed to do so

## Synchronization

Files in this directory are automatically synchronized with your Naas Workspace storage under the "abi" directory. This ensures:
- Data persistence across sessions
- Backup of important files
- Access to your data from different environments
