## Configuration

### Prerequisites

1. **Anthropic API Key**: Obtain from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. **Environment Variable**: Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your environment

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_api_key_here"
```

### Model Configuration

```python
# In claude_3_5_sonnet.py
model = ChatAnthropic(
    model_name="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    temperature=0.0,
    max_tokens=4096,
    api_key=SecretStr(secret.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")),
)
```

## Usage Examples

### Direct Agent Interaction

```bash
# Terminal interface
make chat agent=ClaudeAgent
```

### API Usage

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/agents/Claude/completion" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Explain quantum computing principles",
    "temperature": 0.1
  }'
```

### Agent Switching

```bash
# In terminal, switch to Claude
@claude analyze this complex philosophical argument
```

### Programming Integration

```python
from src.core.modules.claude.agents.ClaudeAgent import create_agent

# Initialize Claude agent
claude = create_agent()

# Use for complex analysis
response = claude.invoke({
    "messages": [
        {"role": "human", "content": "Analyze the ethical implications of AI decision-making in healthcare"}
    ]
})
```
