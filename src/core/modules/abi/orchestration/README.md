# ABI Strategic Orchestration

## Overview

Strategic AI industry intelligence collection and orchestration system. Monitors all major AI labs, models, research developments, and funding activities for competitive intelligence and market analysis.

## Purpose

**STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE**: This orchestration system provides real-time monitoring of the AI industry landscape, collecting structured intelligence on:

- **AI Labs**: OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Google DeepMind, Meta AI, Mistral AI, etc.
- **AI Models**: GPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini, Llama, Mistral, Qwen, etc.
- **Research**: AI research, ML research, LLM research, AGI research, AI safety
- **Funding**: AI startup funding, IPOs, acquisitions, valuations

## Architecture

### Code-Data Symmetry
```
Code Structure:                           Data Structure:
src/core/modules/abi/orchestration/       storage/datastore/core/modules/abi/orchestration/
├── definitions.py                        ├── ai_intelligence/
├── __init__.py                           │   ├── labs/           # AI company news
└── README.md                             │   ├── models/         # AI model developments  
                                          │   ├── research/       # Research breakthroughs
                                          └   └── funding/        # Investment & funding
```

### Intelligence Categories

**1. Labs (AI Companies)**
- OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Google DeepMind
- Meta AI, Mistral AI, Perplexity, DeepSeek
- Alibaba Qwen, Cohere, Stability AI, Hugging Face

**2. Models (AI Systems)**
- GPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini, Llama
- Mistral, Qwen, and other major model families

**3. Research (Academic & Industry)**
- AI research, machine learning research
- LLM research, AGI research, AI safety

**4. Funding (Financial Intelligence)**
- AI startup funding and investment
- IPOs, acquisitions, mergers, valuations

## Sensors & Monitoring

**61 Strategic Sensors** monitoring RSS feeds every 5 minutes:
- **12 AI Lab sensors** - Major AI companies
- **7 AI Model sensors** - Specific model families  
- **5 Research sensors** - Academic and industry research
- **4 Funding sensors** - Investment and financial activity

Each sensor processes up to 5 most recent entries to avoid overwhelming the system.

## Data Structure

Each collected intelligence item includes:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "collected_at": "2025-09-02T09:38:00",
    "source_category": "labs|models|research|funding",
    "source_name": "OpenAI",
    "intelligence_type": "rss_feed"
  },
  "content": {
    "title": "Article title",
    "summary": "Article summary", 
    "published": "Publication date",
    "link": "Source URL",
    // ... full RSS entry data
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Start Orchestration
```bash
# Via Docker (recommended)
make dagster-up

# Or directly
export DAGSTER_HOME=/Users/jrvmac/abi/.dagster
uv run dagster dev --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000 -m src.core.modules.abi.orchestration.definitions
```

### Monitor Intelligence
```bash
# Check collected intelligence
ls storage/datastore/core/modules/abi/orchestration/ai_intelligence/labs/
ls storage/datastore/core/modules/abi/orchestration/ai_intelligence/models/
ls storage/datastore/core/modules/abi/orchestration/ai_intelligence/research/
ls storage/datastore/core/modules/abi/orchestration/ai_intelligence/funding/

# Web interface
open http://localhost:3000
```

### Query Intelligence
```bash
# Count intelligence by category
find storage/datastore/core/modules/abi/orchestration/ai_intelligence/labs -name "*.json" | wc -l
find storage/datastore/core/modules/abi/orchestration/ai_intelligence/models -name "*.json" | wc -l

# Search for specific topics
grep -r "GPT-5" storage/datastore/core/modules/abi/orchestration/ai_intelligence/
grep -r "funding" storage/datastore/core/modules/abi/orchestration/ai_intelligence/funding/
```

## Strategic Value

**COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE**:
- Real-time monitoring of AI industry developments
- Early detection of new model releases and capabilities
- Funding and acquisition trend analysis
- Research breakthrough identification

**MARKET ANALYSIS**:
- AI company performance tracking
- Model capability evolution monitoring  
- Investment flow analysis
- Technology trend identification

**DECISION SUPPORT**:
- Strategic planning based on industry intelligence
- Competitive positioning insights

- Partnership and investment opportunities

## Integration with ABI

This orchestration system feeds into ABI's broader intelligence capabilities:

1. **Data Collection** → Strategic RSS monitoring (this system)
2. **Data Processing** → ABI semantic pipelines (future integration)
3. **Knowledge Storage** → ABI knowledge graph (future integration)
4. **Intelligence Analysis** → ABI agent workflows (future integration)

## Future Enhancements

**SEMANTIC INTEGRATION** (Next Phase):
- Connect to ABI semantic pipelines
- Store intelligence in knowledge graph as RDF triples
- Enable SPARQL queries for complex intelligence analysis
- Create AI agent workflows for automated analysis

**ADVANCED MONITORING**:
- GitHub repository monitoring for AI projects
- Patent filing tracking for AI innovations
- Conference and paper publication monitoring
- Social media sentiment analysis

This system transforms ABI from isolated data collection to strategic AI industry intelligence - providing the foundation for informed decision-making in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.
