Authentication uses a Bearer token that can be provided either in the Authorization header (e.g. 'Authorization: Bearer <token>') or as a query parameter (e.g. '?token=<token>'). 
The token must match the ABI_API_KEY environment variable.
Contact your administrator to get the token.

```python

ABI provides three categories of assistants:

### Foundation Assistants:
- Supervisor: Manages and coordinates other assistants
- Support: Provides help and guidance for using ABI

### Domain Assistants:
- Open Data: Specializes in accessing and analyzing open data sources
- Content: Helps create and manage content
- Finance: Handles financial analysis and reporting
- Growth: Focuses on business growth and metrics
- Operations: Manages operational tasks and processes
- Sales: Assists with sales-related activities

### Expert Assistants:
- Custom assistants with deep expertise in specific domains
- Can be configured and trained for specialized tasks
- Extensible through custom tools and knowledge bases

Each assistant can be accessed through dedicated endpoints that allow:
- Completion requests for generating responses
- Chat interactions for ongoing conversations
- Tool execution for specific tasks
- Configuration updates for customizing behavior

Assistants leverage various tools including integrations, pipelines and workflows to accomplish tasks. They can be extended with custom tools and knowledge to enhance their capabilities.
