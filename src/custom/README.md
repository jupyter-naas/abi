# ABI Source Custom Directory
 
 This directory contains custom implementations and extensions of the core functionality. It allows for organization-specific adaptations and specialized features while maintaining separation from the core codebase.
 
 ## Usage
 
 To add custom implementations:
 
 1. Create the appropriate subdirectory if it doesn't exist
 2. Add your custom implementation following the standard patterns
 3. Document any specific requirements or dependencies
 4. Update this README if adding new categories or important information
 
 ## Guidelines
 
 - Keep custom implementations isolated from core functionality
 - Follow the same coding standards as the main project
 - Include appropriate documentation and type hints
 - Add tests for custom implementations when applicable
