# Models Directory

This directory contains model configurations and fine-tuning settings for various AI/ML models used across the project.

## Purpose

The models directory serves several key purposes:

1. **Model Configuration Storage**: Store configuration files for different AI/ML models, including:
   - Language models (LLMs)
   - Embedding models
   - Classification models
   - Custom fine-tuned models

2. **Fine-tuning Settings**: Maintain fine-tuning parameters and configurations:
   - Training hyperparameters
   - Model-specific adjustments
   - Custom prompts and templates
   - Fine-tuning datasets and their preprocessing settings

3. **Model Version Control**: Track different versions of model configurations:
   - Production configurations
   - Development configurations
   - Experimental settings

## Usage

Model configurations in this directory can be imported and used across the project to ensure consistent model behavior and settings. This centralized approach helps maintain standardization and makes it easier to update model configurations across the entire application.

## Best Practices

1. Document all configuration changes
2. Version control significant changes
3. Include performance metrics with configurations
4. Maintain backward compatibility
5. Keep sensitive information in environment variables
