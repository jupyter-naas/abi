Integer Range Validation can be done by programmatically checking the value of an integer before or after an operation to determine if the resulting value will be valid.

Gatekeeper also treats applications running for the first time differently than reopened applications.(Citation: TheEclecticLightCompany Quarantine and the flag)(Citation: TheEclecticLightCompany apple notarization )" ;

### Certificate validity analysis

### Certificate path analysis
The client's browser can perform path verification to ensure that the server's certificate contains a valid trust anchor.

### Certificate configuration analysis
Some browsers can be configured to implement the key-usage extensions contained certificates. This can help to prevent a certificate from being misused.

### Certificate revocation status analysis
Using either Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) to determine the revocation status. OCSP Stapling, binding the status with the certificate, helps to mitigate potential delay in status verifications.

## Considerations
* Management of the PKI across the enterprise typically requires automation to maintain scalability and flexibility

Active logical link mapping establishes awareness of logical links in the network by sending data over the network to gather information about logical connections in the network.

Typically this will be achieved through network telemetry coordinated for network management and monitoring and will use a link layer discovery protocol such as LLDP and the information gathered and aggregated a higher levels using an application protocol such as SNMP.  The information may be polled by network management softare or configured once and then pushed from network sensors (or agents.)

Another means of establishing network connectivity is by means of sendingn traffic through the use of a tool such as traceroute, to determine the logical paths through the network architecture.

## Considerations

* Best practice is to encrypte network monitoring data and require authentication for queries or admin/management functions.
* Push notifications reduce bandwidth necessary to capture and maintain information if reliable transport is used.

Some applications implement logic to permit or deny a particular subroutine access to other data within the same applicaition process. This is intended to prevent critical application process data from being tampered with.

### Application-based Process Isolation in web browsers.

Isolation in browsers usually is designed with the following architectural mindset:
* Sandboxes and web resources should not be allowed to access each other because compromise of one should not effect the other.
* The principle of least-privilege should be followed when browsing.
The following aspects help make browser-based process isolation possible:
* Same Origin Policy
* Separate tabs and iframes use their own DOMs (cross-site document object models always run as a different process)
* CORS ensures cross-site data is not delivered to a process unless the server allows it
* Cookie and local data storage is separated by domain/site
* Separate execution environments (threads)

## Considerations
- Using isolation in browsers does mitigate and protect by default some types of attacks (e.g. renderer attacks and access to the filesystem) but it depends on correct configuration of CORS, use of valid/appropriate certificates.
-  Application-based Process Isolation may increase memory footprint.
-  Application-based Process Isolation may decrease application performance.""" ;

Bytes are analyzed as if they are machine code instructions, and such instructions that are a common component of known shellcode are noted, such as stack pivots, reads from a Memory Address Table, and system calls for functions that disable protections or execute code.  For example, the x86 instruction `b0 0b: mov $11, %ax`, with no further alterations to the `%ax` register, followed by `cd 80: syscall` executes the system call `execve()` in the Linux kernel, which replaces the current process with another one specified -- this is a common action in shellcode, so this sequence would be flagged.

This technique detects shellcode despite whether or not it would cause a buffer overflow in the target binary.

If the sequence of bytes contains a sequence similar to that used in malicious shellcode, the entire byte sequence is flagged and a follow-on technique may be invoked.

## Considerations

### False Negatives
If the shellcode instructions are far apart, simple implementations might not detect the shellcode.

Due to the nature of assembly instructions not having a defined start or end, implementations which do not process all start sequences (for example, when they a find byte sequence of interest, continue scanning forwards from the end of it) might not detect the shellcode.

This technique might not detect more complex or obfuscated instructions.  For that purpose, Dynamic Analysis or Emulated File Analysis could assist by analyzing the actual instruction function.

This technique may not detect self-modifying code.  To make it harder for a process to modify itself, Process Segment Execution Prevention should be used, while noting its considerations.

This technique might not detect malicious shellcode which reuses instructions in the target binary for malicious effect, as memory references in the presumed assembly code are not dereferenced.  Dynamic Analysis and Emulated File Analysis, when set up properly to fork from the running target binary, might detect this.  Process Segment Execution Prevention combined with Segment Address Offset Randomization frequently makes introduction of shellcode through overwriting a saved return pointer more difficult.  Call stack depth analysis might detect excessive reuse of instructions in the target binary.  Shadow Stack Frames might detect that a stack frame's return address has changed and Stack Frame Canary Verification might detect that the stack frame's return address was overwritten.  Other heuristic methods might detect jump-oriented programming shellcode.

With inserting code directly, that it is not a buffer overflow, and just some place where code is executed either to a file or a write-what-where, the buffer overflow mitigations do not help.  Behavioral analysis could detect this, or proper access control could mitigate this.

### False Positives

Byte sequences containing code that is never used as machine code are still analyzed and flagged for anomalies, and [eventually](http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/55871.html), it is likely that an attack sequence will arise from the sheer volume of bytes transmitted.""" ;

Pinning allows for a trusted copy of a certificate or public key to be associated with a server and thus reducing the likelihood of frequently visited sites being subjected to man-in-the-middle attacks. Certificates or public keys can be pinned after a trusted connection has been established or the pinning can be preloaded in an application, which is the preferred method for mobile applications.

Pinning can take the form of certificate pinning or public key pinning.

## Forms of Pinning
* Certificate Pinning (CP) allows for the client to verify the X.509 certificate with a preloaded certificate. Typically, this is involves storing a hash of the certificate and using the stored hash for comparison to the hash of the certificate submitted during the SSL handshake.

* Public Key Pinning (PKP) requires the extraction of a public key from server's certificate. The stored public key is compared to the server's presented public key. A public key is expected to rotate less frequently than an X.509 certificate and is generally favored over certificate pinning.

An extension of PKP is Subject Public Key Information Pinning (SPKI) includes public key pinning plus additional information for SSL connections. The additional information can include preferred algorithms.

## Considerations

* With pinned certificates whenever a server updates its certificate, the pinned certificates will also need to be updated
* With pinned public keys the extracted key may be subject to key refresh policies but much less frequently
* Servers can become unavailable if pinned objects are set and not updated with the rotated identities. This may require a pinning strategy to be developed.
* The application of this technique within web browser applications has been [deprecated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Public_Key_Pinning) by  popular web browser developers.

### Monitoring for sequentially transmitted traffic
Another approach passively inspects network traffic with application protocol analyzers observing network activity characteristics such as volume of packets sent/ received, TCP session attributes, and connection information between hosts (start time, source/destination host, services, etc.). Then using pattern matching to identify traffic which appears to be probing for network hosts.

Container images are standalone collections of the executable code and
content that are used to populate a container environment.
They are usually created by either building a container from scratch or by
building on top of an existing image pulled from a repository.

Throughout the container build workflow,
images should be scanned to identify:

- outdated libraries,
- known vulnerabilities,
- or misconfigurations, such as insecure ports or permissions.

Scanning should also provide the flexibility to disregard false positives
for vulnerability detection where knowledgeable
cybersecurity professionals have deemed alerts to be inaccurate.

One approach to implementing image scanning is to use an admission controller
to block deployments if the image does not comply with the organization's
security policies.

An admission controller is a Container Orchestration feature that can intercept and
process requests to the Container Orchestration API prior to persistence of the object,
but after the request is authenticated and authorized.
A webhook can be implemented to scan any image before it is deployed in the orchestrator.
This admission controller

## Considerations

* Image scanning is key to ensuring deployed containers are secure.

#### Memory
Credentials may be stored in memory for a variety of reasons; on Windows, they may be stored in lsass.exe.  Once a credential dumper like mimikatz runs and dumps the memory of lsass.exe, the credentials of every account logged on since boot are potentially compromised.
When such an event occurs, this analytic will give the forensic context to identify compromised users. Those users could potentially be used in later events for additional logons.


#### Hard disk
Operating System may cache a certain number of credentials onto the hard disk to use as a source of truth if it cannot contact the credential server.  In many versions of Microsoft Windows, the 10 most recent are cached by default; this setting can be changed in the Microsoft Management Console's Local Security Policy: ```Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings -> Local Policy -> Security Options -> Interactive Logon: Number of previous logons to cache -> 0```  Here we are not concerned with the alteration of the credentials but the fact that they might be read.  If the attacker has physical access to the machine they are unlikely to be stopped from reading files on the filesystem.
"In the event that the domain controller is unavailable Windows will check the last password hashes that has been cached in order to authenticate the user with the system. These password hashes are cached in the following registry setting:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SECURITY\\Cache
Mimikatz can retrieve these hashes if the following command is executed:
lsadump::cache" [1]

The Registry Hive, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SAM, which is stored in the supporting files %systemroot%\\System32\\Config\\{Sam,sam.log,sam.sav}, contains the SAM file.

DC: This is stored in %systemroot%\\ntds\\ntds.dit. (https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/blog/default.aspx?d=10/2017)

Sometimes memory, which contains credentials, could get on the hard disk. Like with hiberfil.sys in Windows.  Equivalent on Linux


In Linux, an attacker could read the /etc/shadow file.

Reading from /proc directory: mimipenguin, many others.

## Considerations
Effective implementation requires identifying any location that could end up containing credentials, and detecting an method of potential access to a source of credential data.

This technique can be accomplished in a number of ways.

* One example analytic determines whether or not a domain name was generated with an algorithm. Domain generation algorithms (DGAs) are sometimes used to create a domain name automatically  that will resolve to C2 infrastructure, without directly coding the domains in question into the malicious code.
* Another method analyzes information about domains that have been visited, including whether a domain name is longer than a common length,  if a dynamic DNS domain was visited, if a fast-flux domain was visited, and if a recently created domain was visited. These factors are used to develop a score and if that score is over a certain threshold, an alert is generated.
* Collected malware samples can be executed in a virtual environment to identify network domains that are connected to during execution. The network domains are then generated into signatures to identity bad domains for other hosts.

This technique does not check for content hosted at the domain.

## Considerations

* DNS produces a large amount of traffic which can be resource-intensive to analyze in real time.
* If a server is compromised, for example, as part of a watering hole attack, but the DNS information pointing to that server is not altered, this technique would not catch such an incident.""" ;

Most nameserver hosts and domain name registrars comply with internationally recognised standards and supply their services based on terms and conditions that provide users and organisations protection from abuse and trademark infringement.

Formal takedown processes should be initiated to suspend or disable the normal function of the domain name.

## Considerations

- Takedown notifications should clearly demonstrate (with evidence) that the nameserver or registrars Terms and Conditions have been breached.
- Takedown processes are notoriously slow and sometimes unsuccessful.
- Many government organisations will have takedown processes that should also be followed. They may use this for intelligence to assist other organisations suffering an attack.
- Top level domain registrars will have takedown processes that can be followed, as an escalation path, when the nameserver host and/or registrar have not responded or complied timeously or inline with the TLD expectations.

## Examples of Domain Registration Abuse

Attackers will create infrastructure from which to carry out their operations and this may include registering domain names to be used in the various attacks. Known misuse cases include:

- Registering domain names that are similar to the victim's. This is known as typosquatting or URL hijacking. Legitimate looking mails or URLs could be sent using this domain in phishing campaigns.

* Kernel components can be signed by a certificate obtained by a third party to verify the source of the component and whether it has been modified.

In the case that no valid exception handler is found, the program would fail to proceed as normal and could be programmed to terminate.

In Windows, the address of the exception registration record is stored at the very start of the the Thread Information Block; the GS register points to this structure.

The exception registration record contains two pointers: a pointer to the next exception registration record should this handler fail to handle the exception, and a pointer to the handler.

A buffer overflow can overwrite the saved return pointer with an invalid location to execute memory; this often triggers the exception handler chain, which could also be corrupted by the buffer overflow.  Although Process Exception Handler Validation does not make sure that the exception handler pointer or the code at the exception handler was unaltered, or that the exception handler code is secure, this technique does ensure that the pointer is at least an exception handler that could be called by the program.

With Process Exception Handler Validation, before the handler is called, it checks the exception handler against a source of valid exception handlers.  If the requested handler is not in this list, other techniques such as those in Process Eviction might be invoked, such as Process Termination to end the current process, or Executable Blacklisting to blacklist the potentially vulnerable or malfunctioning executable.

### Runtime valid exception handler source generation
The source of valid exception handlers could be generated at runtime, with the risk of the information that is used to determine the validity of exception handlers being compromised.

### Compile-time
The source of valid exception handlers could also be generated at compile time or as a binary patch.  Given the source code, it would be rather straightforward to find the exceptions, as they are pointed in the catch statement of a try-catch clause and the compiler must already generate the code to call exceptions from this.

## Considerations
If the program file can be altered by the attacker, then the security could be bypassed by replacing it with any desired program, without even bypassing SEH.

If the attacker was already able to overwrite the code for a valid exception handler via other functionality in the program, this defense would not prevent arbitrary code execution.
If an exception handler recognized as valid is vulnerable, it would be executed anyway.

SafeSEH might be applied only to some executable files or modules, allowing an attacker to call any piece of code as an exception handler in the unprotected modules.""" ;

This technique is generic and there are numerous ways to compute and authenticate digital signatures.
A digital certificate is generated from a private/public key pair issued by a certificate authority (CA). A hash of the file is encrypted using the private key. When the file is downloaded by another user, the user's system uses the public key to decrypt the hash and a new hash is created of the downloaded file. The hash decrypted by the public key is compared to the new hash and if there is a mismatch, further techniques, such as file deletion, file quarantine, or **Executable Blacklisting** may be invoked.

This technique may be invoked when deciding whether to execute a file.

#### Criteria

A policy-enforcing application can register an application for denylisting based on conditions including the following:

* File attributes
    * file name
    * file path
    * file hash
    * file publisher, as obtained from the digital signature
    * permissions of the file
* File malware scan (eg. Windows SmartScreen)
* User-File combination

This may be done to prevent execution of applications which are:

* an old version with known vulnerabilities
* without a valid license, which could cause legal issues
* in a directory that is accessible to low-privileged users, that could be accessed by a malware dropper
* known trojan horse programs
* too open in their permissions, possibly set to run as a user other than the originator or allowing execution when they should not be
* a match to the hash of other known malware
* are detected as undesirable based on a file scan runtime behavior

System administrators will customize the rules for the given environment.

#### Backend

The policy-enforcing program may work by running in kernel mode, and [intercepting] [system calls which execute a process].

## Considerations

* If denylisting is done by filename, filepath, or hash, these mechanisms may be a worthy first line of defense and detection, but could still be evaded by an attacker.
* Continuous management is needed to keep the denylist up to date, whether it is based on hash, publisher, behavior, or any other digital artifact.
* Although denylists based on attributes such as file path and virus scan could defend against some threats which they have not been explicitly coded to block, denylists may not provide protection from new, unknown, or zero day attacks.

     * The computational load for scanning, and

Symmetric encryption uses the same cryptographic key for both the encryption and decryption a file. Managing keys at scale sometimes uses asymmetric key exchange. Protocols such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman can be used to share the symmetric cryptographic key with the others.

### Asymmetric Cryptography
Asymmetric encryption is typically accomplished using public and private key certificates based on the X.509 standard. Files are encrypted using the public key and decrypted using their private key. Asymmetric encryption is typically slower than symmetric encryption and not widely used for large file encryption, but is popular for key wrapping, key exchanges, and digital signatures.

Firmware in deployed network devices is typically not analyzed and monitored for vulnerabilities and thus is subject to potential attacks. This technique makes use of known and measured behavioral attributes, including timing attributes, of analyzed firmware on deployed devices.

A behavioral method that employs known timing measurements may use the timing results from a challenge and response protocol to detect the presence of malware in embedded firmware. Firmware device timing measurements are made, specific to the installed device, and are used in the verifying function.

The original firmware image is modified by injecting a monitoring software component into the embedded firmware code. The injected software components will allow for a software root of trust, the challenge and response protocol, to be implement in the firmware.

A challenge-response is issued and includes a nonce so that replays are not allowed. The firmware will calculate a checksum over all of memory, including the nonce, and return the result. The verification system will compare the computed checksum and the time it took for the computation of the checksum to determine if the firmware has been modified.

The injected software components provide a feature similar to intrusion detection systems for the firmware by detecting unauthorized modifications of the embedded firmware. The integrity of static code and firmware data are monitored continuously in the hosted devices. Comparisons are made to monitored elements like firmware memory addresses and data segments. Memory pages are scanned and if a modification is detected the software component may lock the page. This will protect subsequent attempted modifications to the firmware.

The injected software components are inserted during the firmware imaging process.

This technique prevents a client from learning IP addresses deemed to be potentially malicious, which would have been delivered via forward resolution responses.

If the IP address(es) are in a range included in the blacklist, then the response is dropped and not forwarded to the client.

The DNS lookup can be blocked by either dropping the network traffic with an inline device, or modifying the value of the response sent by the DNS server. To transparently prevent client applications from hanging on a request, it is common practice to replace malicious values with addresses in the range 127.0.0.0/8 or the address of a honeypot maintained by the network administrators.

## Considerations

* This technique does not prevent the client from contacting the blacklisted IP, only from learning about this IP address via a nameserver lookup request.
* DNS Response traffic can be transmitted over many different protocols, which presents a challenge to implementing methods to extract all DNS answer IP address value(s).

* This technique must be implemented logically between the application that receives the response and the server which sent the response.

* Process A address space is different from process B address space, which prevents process A from writing to process B

Hardware process isolation is commonly implemented through Direct Memory Access (DMA) which collaborates with a Memory Management Unit (MMU), or Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU). These hardware controls are deployed directly on processors to aid hosts or enclaves in process isolation.

* DMA - Direct memory access allows memory access to occur independently of the program currently run by the microprocessor. DMA allows for I/O devices to directly read from and write to memory, or it can be used to efficiently copy blocks of memory. During DMA transfers, the microprocessor can execute an unrelated program.
* MMU - A memory management unit acts as an access control and is responsible for performing the translation of virtual memory addresses to physical memory addresses. The MMU allocates each process its own virtual memory space.
* IOMMU - An input-output memory management unit is used to allocate each I/O device its own virtual address space to the underlying physical addresses. IOMMU allows devices that do not support long memory addresses to address the entire memory space.

Hardware-based restriction can also be employed to limit access to IO ports.

When new devices are connected to the USB filter the type of device is determined. Using an allow list a connection determination is made for the device.

Some implementations detect when a device is connected in order to authorize the connection against a list of approved devices, in some cases by device type. For example, if the device is determined to be a storage device, then the contained files and executables are examined to more accurately identify the device type.

Defenders can search for these indicators of compromise their own systems to gain context on activity around an identifier.

This technique is used to detect an attacker attempting to exploit and execute code on a target system's call stack using return-oriented programming (ROP). Modern processors that have the ability to maintain a list of the branching calls, e.g., Intel's Last Branch Recording (LBR), can be used to track and analyze indirect branching calls that are indicative of malicious activity.

In order to reduce the number of indirect branch calls to analyze to a manageable set it is assumed that malicious ROP activity will involve the use of system calls.  The technique observes indirect branch calls that are part of paths that lead to system calls, all others are ignored. Branching calls chained together is often referred to as gadgets and gadgets are often used in ROP attacks. Indirect branch calls that involve a transfer from user-space to kernel-space are of interest for this technique.

Identification of potential ROP exploit execution includes:

- Inspecting the LBR when a system function call is made

  - The LBR is configured to return only instruction of interest (ret, indirect jmp, indirect calls)


- Behavior is analyzed for
  - Ret instructions that appear to target areas not preceded by the call sites
  - Sequences of small code fragments that appear to be chained through the indirect branching calls (gadgets)


- Of interest are returns that appear to not render control back after calls
  - Typical ret-call are paired
  - gadgets will appear to have ret followed by instruction of next instruction of the following gadget


## Considerations

* May be operating system dependent since specific system calls are used to scope branching behavoir
* Processors need to support access to a Last Branch Recording list feature
* The size of the LBR stack can limit the expected size of the analyzed execution stack

Input Device Hardening techniques filter certain commands, or disable related operating system functionality.

### Analytics

All of these values can be analyzed and compared to a baseline:

* Amount of input
* Duration of a single input
* Durations between inputs
* Value of input

Context can also include:

* User which is logged in, to include attributes such as physical location of the user
* Date and time
* System which is processing the input
* Source device of input, to include its properties (eg. manufacturer), configuration (eg. keyboard layout) and behavioral attributes of this device (eg. first use)
* Source system of input (local or remote system)
* Other hardware devices attached to the system


### Actions

Actions can include:

* Disabling the source device
* Sending an alert
* Locking the current session (eg. system screen lock, or returning to an authentication screen in a web app) and requiring one or more methods of authentication to continue
* Administratively disabling credentials for the account or the entire account -- the technique *Account Locking*


### Examples
A malicious input device sends many keystrokes with approximately the same delay between each.  This does not match the normal cadence of input, and the device is disabled.

Input to type the session user's name takes abnormally longer for each keystroke.  The system is locked to the password prompt screen.

A system receives key press events from two different devices -- one device sends keystrokes after the other has been idle for a long time.

A system receives physical input in a user session, while that user has sent input from a device located out of the country in the past hour.

Network traffic is suddenly routed through a new external device, and nearly the same volume of network traffic is subsequently sent out the previously existing interface.  The new external device is disabled, and an alert is raised to investigate the network configuration for a potential compromise.

### Digital Signature
Digital signatures are used to verifying a message is from the expected sender. In email, Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) protocol is typically used to digitally sign messages. A hash value of the sender's message is created and encrypted with the sender's private key to create a digital signature. The message and the digital signature are sent to the recipient where the sender's public key is used to decrypt the digital signature and compute the hash of the message. The computed hash is compared with the hash from the received message, and any difference in the hash values signify the message did not originate from the sender and has been alerted in transit.

### Message Authentication Code (MAC)
MAC is a fixed size string that is appended to a message to provide message authentication and integrity. The sender MAC signing algorithm takes as input a secret symmetric key shared between sender and recipient and the message to calculate a short tag that is appended to the message. The recipient receives the message with the appended tag, and a MAC verification algorithm is run using the symmetric key to verify the message came from the stated sender and ensure the message has not been tampered with.

## Considerations
- Public keys associated with digital signatures should be verified by a Certification Authority (CA) to prevent impersonation. The CA verifies the owner of a public key and puts the sender's identity and public key into a certificate that is signed by the CA.
- Digital signatures provide non-repudiation where a third party can verify the authenticity of the message using the sender's digital certificate signed by the CA.
- Symmetric keys must be exchanged securely via a private channel and management of new symmetric keys are needed for each pair of participants wishing to exchange messages.""" ;

Network signature analysis relies on predefined patterns, or signatures, to identify malicious network activity. These signatures typically match against specific byte sequences, packet header information, or protocol anomalies indicative of known threats.

The process works as follows:

* Packet Capture: Network traffic is captured on an interface or port, resulting in a stream of raw packets.
* Preprocessing: The captured packets are preprocessed, cleaning and normalizing the data for efficient analysis.
* Signature Matching: Each packet is compared against a database of signatures using dedicated engines.

## Considerations

### False Negatives

Network signature analysis is susceptible to generating false negatives. These occur when malicious activity evades detection due to limitations in the signature-based approach. Here are some common causes:

* Evolving threats: Attackers frequently modify their tactics, rendering existing signatures ineffective against new variants.
* Obfuscation: Attackers may disguise malicious content using encryption, encoding, or other techniques to bypass signature detection.
* Limited visibility: Signatures rely on specific patterns. If crucial information is encrypted or hidden, the signature might miss the threat.
* Zero-day attacks: By definition, new and unknown attacks lack corresponding signatures, allowing them to pass undetected.

### False Positives

Network signature analysis is susceptible to generating false positives. These occur when the signature analysis triggers an alert for benign traffic. Common causes include:

* Overly broad signatures: Rules designed to be too general might match harmless activities, generating false alarms.
* Network misconfigurations: Improperly configured devices or legitimate network activity can mimic malicious patterns, triggering false positives.
* Data errors: Corrupted or incomplete network data can lead to misinterpretations and false alerts.

For example:

* An enterprise desktop intranet user connecting to www.example.com
* An internal mail server connecting to an external mail server, mail.example.com

Filtering is commonly implemented as firewall rulesets to limit outbound traffic permitted to egress a host or network. Firewalls are deployed either directly on hosts through kernel level software implementations or installed in-line directly on network links. There are benefits and disadvantages to each approach.

There are various strategies for developing filtering rulesets:

* Block everything by default
* Limit destination hosts
* Limit destination transport or application protocols
* Restrict content outbound (Ex. strings formatted as social security numbers, or proprietary data)

## Considerations
* Dynamic IP assignment creates challenges for Outbound Traffic Filtering because users are not necessarily associated with the same IP address. This can be addressed by linking IP address management information with the filtering logic.
* Connections using non-standard transport layer ports may circumvent outbound traffic filtering technology which does not detect application protocol based on traffic content.
* Business requirements typically drive the development of filtering rule sets.

Certificates are analyzed outside of a TLS server connection using third-party secure update logs, domain name analysis and analytics.

### Secure update certificate logs
* Certificate Logs
The key enabling feature is a secure service that maintains record logs of certificate activities. The logs allow users to only append certificates and never to delete or modify the log entries. The logs use Merkle Tree Hashes to ensure they have not been tampered with. The logging service also allows for public auditing by any user.

The logging service, upon receipt of a certificate to log, will respond with a signed certificate timestamp (SCT). The SCT guarantees the certificate will be added to the log within the time specified. The SCT must be present with the certificate during a TLS handshake.

* Certificate Monitoring
Certificate monitoring, of the logs, is typically done by the CA and they watch for suspicious certificate logging and unusual certificates or extensions or permissions. Monitors are also responsible for verifying the logs are accurate and public.

* Certificate Auditors
Log integrity is verified by log auditors. Auditors make use of log proofs are used to validate the cryptographic hashes (Merkle Trees) that the log employs are consistent. In order to ensure consistency throughout multiple monitors and auditors, sharing a common logging service, gossip protocol is employed.

### Phishing domain name analysis
* A curated corpus of known benign domains and phishing domain names is used as training text for machine learning. Through the use of feature set extraction, vectors labels are created with scoring to indicated if they are considered benign or phishing domains.

* A stream of new or updated SSL certificates with fully qualified domain names (FQDN) is analyzed against the feature vectors and a predictive model determines a score for the domains. The scoring considers distance measures such as Levenshtein distance to help in determining the final label score. Supervised learning is also employed using the curated domains of benign and phishing domains.

* Subdomain phishing analysis, prepending a trusted domain to a phishing domain, and regular expression comparisons  are also used in the label scoring model. A tunable measure is used to determine the threshold for alerting. This measure helps to balance between precision and recall measures.

## Considerations
* Some entity will need to run the logging service and a trusted entity is preferred.
* Certificate Authorities will likely need to monitor the logging service for consistency.
* Certificate revocation is unchanged and remains outside of Certificate Transparency, but certificates needing to be revoked are visible.
* Technique dependent of reliable feed of new and updated certificates
* Some certificate authorities allow for certificates to be registered with wildcards in the FQDN and thus will fail some of the subdomain scoring
* Phishing HTTP domains will not be discovered""" ;

    :kb-article """## How It Works

Pointer Authentication (frequently referred to as PAC, although the technique is properly Pointer Authentication) is a security feature to provide protection against attackers with memory read/write access.  A Pointer Authentication Code (PAC) is a cryptographic hash or derivative computed on the value of a pointer and some additional context information which can then provide a cryptographically strong guarantee about the likelihood that a pointer has been tampered with by an attacker.

Although pointers are 64 bits, most systems have a substantially smaller virtual address space, leaving unused bits in pointers that can store the value of the PAC, this can be done to reduce memory space requirements. One implementation is in ARMv8.3-A.  A PAC is computed over the 64-bit pointer value and a 64-bit context value.  Instructions are introduced to deal with pointers: one category to compute and insert the PAC into a pointer, another category to verify the pointer and invalidate the pointer if the PAC does not check, and a third category to remove the pointer and restore the original value without verifying.

The ARM standard specifies a cryptographic algorithm called QARMA-64 (designed by Qualcomm) to compute the signature, although this algorithm is not required.  The architecture provides for five secret 128-bit Pointer Authentication keys: two for instruction pointers, two for data pointers, and a general key for signing larger blocks of data.

## Considerations

In the ARM implementation, the mechanisms above for manipulating PACS are provided, but it is up to the code developer to manage the keys for the cryptographic algorithm.


A known potential limitation of PACs concerns signing gadgets. Under certain circumstances PACs can be bypassed by forcing the system to run a signing gadget which will allow the signing of arbitrary pointers to occur.""" ;

    :kb-article """## How it works
A process code segment is an executable portion of computer memory allocated to a particular process. Process Code Segment Verification implements verification to compare a process code segment to some expected value.

### Verification logic
Verification can occur during application startup, or continuously during execution. The logic which verifies the process code may be separate in a third-party process, embedded in the application itself at compile time, or dynamically linked at runtime.

### System of record
Examples of systems of record:

 * On-disk application binary files or checksums
 * Remotely stored binary data or checksums
 * Embedded binary data or checksums

### Post Verification Actions
If the verification function determines a process code segment may have been altered, a capability may invoke Eviction techniques  as **Process Termination** to end the current process, or **Executable Blacklisting** to prevent the executable from launching in the future.

## Considerations

### False positives

False positives commonly occur in the case that the layout of code in the process segment is legitimately modified:

*  Operating system features or third-party security software may modify the layout of process code, for example in the defensive technique **Segment Address Offset Randomization**, or in the case that a module is rebased.  In both of these cases, the alteration occurs before the code is fully loaded into memory, and it would be possible to avoid the false positive by securely feeding this constant offset and any relocation data into the verification logic.

* Process code segments may be written to modify themselves or other process code segments; however, this goes against widely-accepted current practices in software development.

### False negatives

False negatives can occur via alteration of the verification logic or source of truth, or insufficient verification logic.

* Verification techniques which are executed only locally may be defeated by altering the local verification logic.

* Verification that is run only on a recurring basis could be evaded if the malicious alteration is completed before verification is run.

* Verification that requests an operation to be performed on a subset of the code segment could be evaded by performing that operation on a copy of the relevant bytes of the code segment.

* Verification based on a system of record that can be altered may fail if that system of record is modifiable by a malicious user.""" ;

Process tree analysis techniques gather information on how a process was initiated to determine if a process is malicious.

Also, if a new process was started before a process initiated by the device (ex. during boot) and that new process was not initiated by a user (which can be determined by examining process parameters such as type of process, its creator, source, etc.) the process is identified as suspicious.

For example, Microsoft Word may block execution of any subprocess that is not in an approved path.

    :kb-article """## How it works

During execution of a process, the instruction pointer register should only point to addresses in a code segment (also called the .text segment), as this is the sole segment which should contain program code.

When this technique detects an attempt to execute something that has been designated as non-executable, other techniques such as those in **Process Eviction** might be invoked, such as **Process Termination** to end the current process, or **Executable Blacklisting** to blacklist the potentially vulnerable or malfunctioning executable.

### Software-based implementations
The software-based implementation in Windows XP SP2 might not check that every time the instruction pointer is changed, and does not check on each jump or return.  Before calling an exception handler, Windows XP SP2 software-enforced DEP checks whether the exception handler is located in a memory region marked as executable.  If the program was also built with SafeSEH, this implementation also checks before changing control to the exception handler whether it is a registered exception handler in the program's file on disk.

### Hardware-based implementations
The NX (No Execute) or XD (Execute Disable) bit on the processor specifies whether a certain part of memory is executable.  Early implementations set this bit by the memory segment, while modern implementations which are built on the flat memory model often store this bit in each entry of the page table, to control execution by the page.


## Considerations

Non-hardware process data segment execution prevention is more susceptible to being able to be turned off for a page of memory.

Different implementations of this defense have been in place since the 1980s, but implementation stalled when larger 16-bit programs began stuffing code in the segments usually reserved for data. Many modern programs follow the best practice of separation of code and data, are able to run under this defense.

ROP or ret2libc/return-to-function attacks could bypass this defense, as although they may pass attacker-controlled data or stack frames to a function, they abuse functions that are legitimately located in the .text segment (code segment) of the program.  For those, more advanced defenses such as a table of valid jump addresses, function call analysis, or return depth analysis could be used.""" ;

An external attacker takes remote control of a host inside a company or organization's network and manually directs offensive techniques. Nonstandard terminal sessions and abnormal behaviors are analyzed in this technique. Abnormal behavior detection includes analysis of user input patterns in the real-time session, keyboard output and packet inspection.

### Network Traffic Inspection
Network traffic from internal hosts is the main concern and focus for the traffic inspection. The network traffic is collected into inspection groups. The groups of traffic are assembled into distinct pair flows (outbound/inbound) and the pair flows are further divided into sessions. Only sessions originated inside of the network are considered for the inspection. Traffic inspection includes analysis to determine if a human is involved in the session exchanges. Time-based statistics are captured for each session being analyzed by the detection engine.

### Algorithm Analysis Description
Analysis algorithms look for patterns in the network traffic captured from the session data.  A detection engine groups the session traffic data, between the hosts, into rapid exchange instances. Analysis of rapid exchange traffic patterns can lead to the discovery of abnormal behavior which is indicative of a compromised internal host. The analysis algorithms look for patterns in the traffic which correlate to known activity (e.g., relay attacks, bot activity, bitcoin mining). Some metrics used during inspection include the following.

* Number of rapid-exchange instances
* Time interval between packets
* Fixed cadence of traffic
* Rhythm and direction of the initiation of instances
* Volume of data flowing from internal to external controlling host
* Data transfer characteristics
* Variability in length of silent periods

* Full packet capture is required which can be process intensive to analyze

Many application exploits rely on an attacker specifying a location in memory, which points to data or code used by the attacker.  If the addresses are changed each time the program is run, then it becomes more difficult for the attacker to determine the location that will contain the code they wish to run.

Imported modules may be similarly realigned if their default memory addresses conflict with other modules, in a process known as "rebasing."  Just as not all code is built for participation in ASLR, not all modules can be rebased; instead, modules must indicate whether they implement support for rebasing.  Such information to relocate the executable is typically stored in the ".reloc" segment -- each of the addresses pointed to in this segment has its address increased by the amount of the offset.
(An alternative method for relocation would be to add an amount to a global variable each time -- leading to less overhead in the module load, but more for each access.  Still another implementation could instead contain code to deference each changeable memory location on the fly, so that each of the references do not need to be updated.


## Considerations

As the offset for each segment is constant, it is possible to guess at the value of the address given the address of another variable.  Alternatively, memory pointers may be kept around, which contain the address of another variable.
Another bypass technique is known as an "egg hunt," whereby the attacker searches for a rather unique piece of the data or code in memory to determine its likely address.

The program needs to store these addresses for the functions somewhere.  In Linux, the PLT contains a "trampoline" to these addresses.  If an attacker desires to jump to the start of an existing function, they can jump directly to the trampoline anyway, and may have the opportunity to provide their own stack frame to the function with a write to the stack. If they overwrite a saved stack pointer which is loaded back into memory, or execute a function, that changes the address of a stack pointer.

If an attacker wants to inject some data into the program, for example as a parameter to a known function that is not under ASLR or a pointer to a trampoline function in the PLT, then they can repeat the data until they exceed the range of ASLR coverage, which on 32-bit systems is accomplishable in a few seconds with a heap spray.  Microsoft's EMET and Windows 10 Exploit Guard can pre-allocate particular addresses that are commonly used in heap sprays.  However, in many products, there does not seem to be nearly a complete coverage of such addresses, which only need to be executable and in the range of the heap; 0x0c0c0c0c is such an address that is commonly used for the x86 processor architecture, as when executed it only performs a numeric operation to a register four times.""" ;

    :kb-article """## How it works

This defense must be applied at compile-time, or via a patch to the program binary.  Stack Frame Canary Verification inserts instructions at the prologue and epilogue of desired functions.  In the prologue, a canary value, typically with the same size as the register size, is stored in the system of record and on the stack.  Typically, the canary is loaded to where it has a memory address just below that of the saved instruction pointer and base pointer.  In the epilogue, the canary value stored on the stack and, is compared to the canary value in the system of record.  If the values are different, other techniques such as those in Process Eviction might be invoked, such as Process Termination to end the current process, or Executable Blacklisting to blacklist the potentially vulnerable or malfunctioning executable.

Stack Frame Canary Verification is commonly used to detect potential tampering of a saved register value on the stack before it has been restored.  Examples of registers with values commonly saved to the stack include the instruction pointer and the base pointer.

The canary should be stored between where the start of a buffer overrun is likely, and the data to protect, in cases where the buffer size increases it will overwrite the data to be protected.

On most processor architectures, including x86, x64, and ARM, a "push" operation to store data to the stack grows the stack towards a lower memory address.  As in these architectures, saved register values are stored to the stack at a point in time just before space is made for the local function variables, the saved register values have a higher address than that of the local function variables.  Values at increasing indexes of a buffer are written to increasing memory addresses; therefore, an overwrite in the local variable buffer could overwrite saved register values, and a stack canary between these two would be useful in detecting an overwrite.

On some other processor architectures such as the B5000, the stack grows towards increasing memory addresses, and some architectures, such as System Z and RCA1802A, stack direction can be chosen.  If the stack grows towards increasing memory addresses, while this architecture inherently provides more protection against a saved register being overwritten, other data including local function variables might be overwritten.


## Considerations

There are several ways that the protection provided by a canary could be rendered ineffective.

### Performing a malicious action before the canary is checked

If the attacker alters the memory in such a way that it performs a malicious action before the epilogue is called, then this protection will not be effective.  This includes altering the logic of the program by altering the values of local variables stored on the function stack, or by causing an exception and exploiting the exception mechanism such as the SEH (Structured Exception Handling) mechanism on Windows.

### Determining the canary value

Determining the canary value is possible through reading memory either for the code used to check the canary, or from the stored canary value itself in a stack frame.

### Changing the canary value

A vulnerability such as a write-what-where condition that allows one to write data after the canary in the stack, would allow control of the value of the saved instruction pointer without needing to know the canary value.""" ;

During the boot process, the BIOS boot block (which with this defense enabled, is the Core Root of Trust for Measurement) measures boot components (firmware, ROM). The TPM hashes those measurements and stores the hashes in Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs).  Upon a subsequent boot, these hashes are provided to a verifier which compares the stored measurements to the new boot measurements. Integrity of the boot components is assured if they match.

Attestation of the secure boot occurs when a verifying entity requests a Quote which is a concatenation of the requested PCR values, hashed and signed by the TPM's unique RSA key.  The TPM signature is trusted because the private key is stored securely in hardware and never leaves the TPM.

## Considerations

* The TPM does not perform the follow-on actions of acting on the PCR value information, it just provides the PCR stored information.
* The current version of TPM is 2.0.; most existing implementations use TPM 1.2.

Token-based authentication starts with a user logging into a system, device or application, typically using a password or a security question. An authorization server validates that initial authentication and then issues an access token, which is a small piece of data that lets a client application make a secure call or signal to an API server. Once this initial token-based authentication protocol is completed, the token works like a stamped ticket: The user can continue to seamlessly access the relevant resources, without re-authenticating, for the duration of the token lifecycle. That lifecycle ends when the user logs out or quits an app — and can also be triggered by a set time-out protocol.

While token-based authentication is undoubtedly a major step above traditional password-based authentication, the token is still considered a “bearer token” — that is, access is granted to whomever holds the token.""" ;

Transfer Agent Authentication can be accomplished in different ways for depending on the protocol. In Email, Sender Policy Framework (SPF), Domain Key Identified Email (DKIM) or Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) are used to validate sender domain ownership.

### SPF
SPF protocol allows for mail domain owners to specify the mail servers they use when sending email. SPF requires the use of SPF records published in the Domain Name System (DNS). The records record the authorized IPs for email senders. SPF uses the return-path address for domain IP identification. Email that is forwarded may cause the return-path validation problems.
### DKIM
DKIM also uses a record entry in DNS for authentication but does not rely on the simple return-path for validation. A signature header is added to email and encryption is used for security. This adds an additional layer of complexity and requires that DKIM servers be configured identified cryptographic signatures. The additional complexity results in a validation process that can survive complex routing of emails.

### DMARC
DMARC is an email policy and authentication protocol that seeks to ensure that the "From" field of emails is not spoofed. DMARC makes use of both SPF records and DKIM published key validation. DMARC also has a decision policy framework, contained in a DMARC record, for handling of rejected email. The DMARC framework also updates DMARC domains with authentication statues for allowed senders of that domain.

## Considerations
- Additional work is required to ensure that all SPF, DKIM and DMARC records are current and up to date.
- Maintenance of DKIM signing keys is needed.
- Using SPF without DKIM and DMARC verifies the Return-Path domain however does not prevent spoofing of the displayed From: address.
- Parts of an email that are not signed or verified by email authentication methods, such as the message body or the header To: and Subject: fields, can be altered or modified.
- Email message authentication does not replace the need to do email content analysis since executables, attachments, or links or other parts of the email beyond the sender domain are not verified.""" ;

URLs may contain components, for example:

 * scheme
 * userinfo
 * host name
 * port
 * path
 * query
 * fragment

These components are used as features in analysis algorithms.

Contextual information about a URL such as where it is embedded (ex. emails, files, network protocols), header, path, location, and origin information, as well as information about the content returned from the URL request, may be incorporated into an analytic for URL analysis. For example, if a URL indicates a .pdf file but an executable is actually returned, the combination of these two pieces of information indicates suspicious activity.

Additional techniques include:

* Extracting features of a URL such as domain name length, ratio of consecutive consonants, percentage of digits in a domain, and number of vowels. Values for each feature are combined to develop a score for the URL.
* Determining the probability of a character occurring in the URL given the preceding two characters. For example, for google.com, the probability of a 'g' occurring at the beginning of a word, the probability of an 'o' occurring after a "g, the probability of an o" occurring after a 'g' and "o, and so forth. A dictionary or a list of known good domains is used to determine probability. Probabilities are multiplied to develop a score for the URL.

URL analysis may trigger follow-on analytics such as **File Analysis**

Adversaries may place files or programs into a computer's file system to perform malicious actions. As part of the eviction process, these files and programs should be removed to prevent further compromise or reinfection. Examples of malicious types of files are malware which is directly harmful and content files with the intent to deceive users (e.g., phishing.)

On Windows systems, antivirus (AV) software should be used to safely and permanently remove malicious files. AV software may first quarantine a suspected malicious file, which is the process of moving a file from its original location to a new location and makes changes so that it cannot be executed. Users can then verify that the file is not benign and then permanently delete it.

## Considerations

When it is determined that a file should be removed for security purposes, the organization--or systems implementing an organization's policies--may determine that the file should not simply be deleted from the enterprise's mission systems, but be quarantined to a secure system by an approved mechanism, so as to allow follow-up investigation by security staff.

On Windows systems, deleting a file in File Explorer does not permanently delete a file - it sends it to the Recycle Bin instead. The Recycle Bin must be emptied, or alternative steps must be performed to remove files completely. Even then, in some cases the data may persist in disk, so data shredder tools may be needed to completely wipe a file. Thus, AV tools are recommended.""" ;

 - Attackers could have legitimately compromised any of the process properties, such as the user, to make the execution appear legitimate.
 - Location: If the full image path is not checked, there could be a conflict with an executable that appears earlier due to resolution involving the system environment path/classpath variable.
 - Parsing issues: If the raw command from a shell is analyzed, rather than the actual function call, it is important to identify the actual command  being run from its arguments.

    :kb-article """## How it works

Processes are managed by the operating system kernel.  Different operating system kernels manage the creation and termination of processes in a different manner, and expose this functionality via the kernel API.

A running process might be terminated to mitigate its immediate effects if it is exhibiting anomalous, unauthorized, or malicious behavior; such as after detecting anomalous behavior via <a href="https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:AdministrativeNetworkActivityAnalysis" rdf:about="https://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#AdministrativeNetworkActivityAnalysis">Administrative Network Activity Analysis</a>, after a failed check from <a href="https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:StackFrameCanaryVerification" rdf:about="https://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#StackFrameCanaryValidation">Stack Frame Canary Validation</a>, or after <a href="https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:SystemCallAnalysis" rdf:about="https://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#SystemCallAnalysis">System Call Analysis</a> finds an attempt to execute an unauthorized system call.

### Proprietary technology
Security software might use proprietary technology to terminate processes, instead of the system-provided functions.    Further research may provide specific detail on such methods used.

### System-provided functions

#### Windows tools
In Windows, `ExitProcess()` is used to send a signal to a process to request it to exit, and `TerminateProcess()` is used to force a process to exit.

The `taskkill` executable available in the cmd shell is used to kill a process, with the `/F` switch forcing termination as with `TerminateProcess()`.  In PowerShell, `Stop-Process` is used, which is aliased by default to `spps` and `kill`.  Processes started in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment may be terminated there with the `kill` command.

In some cases, existing drivers can also be leveraged to kill processes.

#### Unix/Linux tools
In Unix-like systems, all process termination requests are handled using signals.  The `kill` function takes the Process ID and signal to send, and is accessible with the `kill` command.  Some shells have a `kill` builtin function which is separate than the `kill` binary, which can also kill background jobs in the shell and additionally perform the function faster, and can run from an existing instance of the shell if the process table is full.  The signal SIGTERM specifies that the process to terminate may invoke a handler that it has defined instead of terminating, and the signal SIGKILL forces immediate termination.

The related command `xkill` terminates the connection of a program to the X window server, after which the user process may decide to terminate itself; however, termination is not guaranteed as the process, which could be on the same or different host, could then run in a terminal or reconnect to a different X server on any host.  Emacs is such a program that would not terminate itself after its connection to the X server is terminated.

## Considerations

### Persistence Mechanisms
Terminating a malicious process is not enough to stop an adversary that has already gained persistence in the host via any initial access mechanism, including through that process or another access mechanism.

### Terminating Multiple Processes
On most operating systems, process termination operations typically occur independently of each other, without functionality provided to atomically terminate multiple processes.  If there are multiple malicious processes which can make system calls to spawn other processes once one of them is closed, user session termination or system restart might be required.

### Process Access Permissions
Users must have permissions to kill the process.  On Unix-like systems, either root or the process user can kill the process.  On Windows systems, process permissions are managed separately via process security tokens.

### Process Resource Handles

#### Terminating Processes with Open Resource Handles

Processes may have open resource handles, which could leave those resources in an undesired state if the process is forced to terminate.  As such, most operating systems provide a means to send a signal to a process to inform it to gracefully terminate, and on most of these operating systems, it is the typical first step used to terminate a process.

#### Signal Traps
As the process may have open resource handles, commonly-used methods of process termination involve sending a signal to the process to terminate.
On Windows, the `ExitProcess()` function is used for this purpose.  Process instructions, as well as a third-party DLL can also cause the process to exit.
On Linux, the process is sent a signal on the occurrence of various events: when it loses the console, `SIGHUP`; when termination is requested, `SIGTERM`.  The processor then redirects execution to the function registered to handle the signal.

Therefore, sending a signal to the process to ask it to terminate may not always work.

##### Avoiding Signal Traps

On Unix-like systems, sending the `SIGKILL` signal for a process does not send a message to the process or invoke an implementation-defined handler; instead, it immediately does not allow the process to execute any further processor instructions.   On Windows `TerminateProcess()` instead of `ExitProcess()` performs the equivalent.

#### Hang on System Call Execution

Even still, as the operating system kernel manages the processes, kernel code may block process signals, including those which cannot be trapped, and does in certain circumstances.  Signals are blocked and queued for the duration of the system call when interrupting the system call would result in a kernel invariant being violated, such as when an action results in a malformed data structure; this blocking is common for filesystem requests.  Such system calls can hang when a filesystem has gone offline, leading to a long-term uninterruptible sleep, represented in POSIX command `ps` output as D state.
Any malicious system calls or system call handlers are issues of a much larger problem (a kernel-level rootkit) and the system should be redeployed entirely or restored from a backup known to be prior to compromise, and other systems accessible directly and indirectly from that one should also be examined.

A process that is truly hung in a system call may prevent the system from shutting down and leave it in an unresponsive state; a hard power off is required.

To speed up the action of terminating a process in uninterruptible sleep, the process resource accesses (handles) could be analyzed.

On Linux, [`sync` followed by `echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches`](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt) is a safe way to free up some inactive resource handles.


#### Kernel Processes and Threads
The kernel may not allow kernel processes, which are created via methods other than user-space processes, to be terminated.

#### Other Code using the Process

Terminating a shared library can lead to unexpected errors; such shared libraries have their own mechanisms for termination.

On Windows, a DLL is unloaded when the reference count of the library reaches 0.

#### Zombie process

After a process has been terminated, it may still take up an entry in the operating system process table until another event occurs.

##### Windows
In Windows, a process object is deleted when the last handle to the process is closed.

##### Linux
In Linux, a process is removed from the process table when it is reaped by its parent process.  If the parent terminates, historically the parent has been changed to pid 1; however, in the Linux kernel 3.4 and above, processes can set a different process as the subreaper using the `prctl()` system call.

Zombie processes and hung processes could be resolved with a restart of the system.

#### System restart
Finally a system restart might be required to kill a process.
Systems which are only accessible via a remote in-band connection may become inaccessible if a process termination operation that is necessary for reboot does not complete.

### Subsystems
Processes that are started in a subsystem might not be fully terminated if they are terminated using the command for that subsystem.  For example, in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), processes started and terminated via WSL calls such as with the `kill` command in Bash may still have an entry in the Windows process table.""" ;

    :kb-article """## How it works

System calls are APIs between a user application and the operating system [1].

By analyzing a process's use of these APIs, it is, in some cases, possible to ascertain whether a program is exhibiting unauthorized behavior, including trying to escalate its privileges.

### Gathering System Calls
A common method to capture system calls is to use kernel APIs to hook [2] a process's system call invocations.

The Linux system call `ptrace` tracks other system calls in a process and allows their alteration; this is made use of by GDB.  `strace` utilizes `ptrace` and will print to stdout each system call invoked. Other applications record this data in local or remote databases.

The log entry for each system call, which may reference additional information such as the date and time, and the process tree for the process which made the system call, is relayed, in real time or post-facto, to an analysis module which consults a catalog or model to determine whether the distribution matches a known-good or known-bad pattern.


### Analysis

System calls are analyzed with a variety of methods. Some analytics look for specific sequences of instructions, others may apply statistical methods to identify abnormal behavior. Sequences of instructions can be abstracted into conceptually higher order user activities, for example:

* An attacker executes many system calls in a short period of time, with several sequences which could be used to escalate privileges.
* Getting the contents from a URL, writing to a new file, and then executing the same file.
* A ransomware program which either uses a loop or creates many threads to: read a specified file, encrypt its contents, create an output file with a similar name to the original file, and delete the unencrypted original.

## Considerations

* Duplicative or extraneous system calls may be added to malware to defeat analytics.
* Malware could replace API hooking instructions to allow system calls to be made without being monitored.
* A model built from a training set of system calls and related data may not be updated fast enough to detect new threats.

    :definition "Controlling access to local computer system resources with kernel-level capabilities." ;
    :kb-article """## How it works
System call filtering uses a mandatory access control paradigm (that is, a non-discretionary access control) system because the rules and polices that determine access is determined by a security control authority and not distributed to local users. Access determinations are based on designed access control polices and are not based on local resource owner determinations.

Access is typically granted by defining sets of subjects and sets of objects. Subjects are the entities requesting access and objects are the resources that subjects are trying to access. Rules and policies are defined that associate subjects and object permissions and access controls.

### Common implementations
#### Security label access control
A fine-grained form control is to apply security labels to individual resources, including processes, and the access control decisions are against a particular resource and a given user attempting to gain access. This type of control requires that the file system has built-in support for security labels.

Access controls are typically implemented through the use of label identifiers for every file system object. Identifier labels are applied to resources and users are assigned a similar access identifier. Users attempting to access a resource will result in the operating system performing an access control check. The access control check will compare the assigned user's credentials to that of the resource or object they are attempting to access.

A security context is associated with resources and is used to determine assess. Typical basic access control elements include users, roles and types and together they form a security context which is the basis for the security labels.

This type of access control is what is employed in SELinux [2]. This form of security kernel access control is considered the most flexible implementation, but it also is the most complex to deploy across the enterprise. Where multiple virtual machines (VM) are run together this type of access control is typically employed to ensure true isolation of processes and VMs.

#### File path level controls
A less fine-grained form of mandatory access control is to apply security labels that allow for access control at the file path level.  Access control is filesystem agnostic and no relabeling of resources is required. Pathname access control usually seems more natural for implementation and corresponding access audits.

This type of system call filtering is what is employed in AppArmor [3]. AppArmor was developed to provide a simpler alternative method with much less management overhead. A simple access policy is maintained that defines path resource access rules. Access control attributes are typically associated with programs instead of users.


## Considerations
Some implementations of security label-based control contain complex rules set that are hard to verify and complex to maintain over time.

Initial planning of access model and continuous monitoring of the available users, resources and object is necessary.

## Implementations

 * Linux C-Groups, and policy engines like SELinux and AppArmor
 * Windows Mandatory Integrity Control introduced in Windows Vista

- Rotation of credentials must be managed carefully to avoid inadvertent service interruption
- Management servers with enterprise policies for account management provide the ability to change or reset passwords for accounts. Some organizations rotate credentials periodically to limit the risk of stolen credentials.
- When responding to an incident, severity of compromise should be considered to determine what credentials to what accounts should be regenerated
- If proactively rotating credentials periodically, several factors should be considered to determine the frequency. Also introduces some risk including promoting the creation of weak passwords and poor storage practices for employees and presents challenges in proper tracking.""" ;

For example, a DNS policy can be created for blocking DNS queries for FQDNs that have been identified as unauthorized.

## Considerations
- Implementation considerations for DNS filtering policies to avoid over-blocking or under-blocking domains.
- Continuous maintenance of unauthorized domain lists is needed to keep up to date with possible site content changes.
- File sharing or content delivery networks may require other filtering techniques that are more fine-grained (URL blocking).
