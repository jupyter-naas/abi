## üìä View Modes Guide

### Kanban Board View
**Best for:** Daily standups, task management
**Usage:**
- Drag cards between columns
- Color coding by priority (Critical=red, High=orange, Medium=yellow, Low=blue)
- Quick status updates

### Timeline View
**Best for:** Project planning, dependency management
**Usage:**
- Gantt chart shows project overlaps
- Progress bars indicate completion
- Scatter plot shows progress vs time remaining

### Resource View
**Best for:** Capacity planning, workload balancing
**Usage:**
- Bar chart shows story points by person
- Pie chart shows team distribution
- Utilization table highlights overallocation

### Sprint View
**Best for:** Agile teams, velocity tracking
**Usage:**
- Burndown chart tracks sprint progress
- Velocity metrics for planning
- Sprint completion tracking

## üéØ Project Status Management

### Status Definitions
- **Backlog:** Not yet started, awaiting prioritization
- **In Progress:** Actively being worked on
- **Review:** Completed, awaiting approval/feedback
- **Testing:** In quality assurance phase
- **Done:** Completed and delivered

### Priority Levels
- **Critical:** Business-critical, immediate attention
- **High:** Important, complete within sprint
- **Medium:** Standard priority, normal timeline
- **Low:** Nice-to-have, flexible timeline

### Progress Tracking
- **0-25%:** Planning and initial setup
- **26-50%:** Active development
