It's Monday again – here are 5 things that caught my attention in the realm of Data & AI:

🤖 AI agents are taking center stage! The sandbox for autonomous agents is now open-source. Imagine the endless possibilities for teamwork and instant solutions across departments. I talked about it in my last post...it's giving me a lot of ideas for business applications and relates to the work we are doing with our 6 foundation engines.

🗣️ Ever chatted with AI and felt like it's just nodding along? You're not alone! The lack of critical thinking is quite an issue. A study reveals how AI language models tend to agree with us, even when we're off track. 

💥 NVIDIA’s wants to fix the GPU Crisis with its GH200 Grace Hopper superchip. Expect mind-bending power and scalability. They're teaming up with Hugging Face, too – imagine the AI magic that's about to unfold!

🚀 Stability AI is here to revolutionize your world, and is committed to make it open source. Three dynamic models are now set to change the coding game.

🔐 Zoom's privacy practices sound like a joke. What's the deal with data usage and privacy?

These computational software agents simulate human behaviors so authentically, they wake up, cook, work, create art, and even remember past events.

Key highlights of the paper that just came out about it: 
✨ Integrated a large language model to record, reflect, and plan agent behavior.
✨ Introduced an interactive environment inspired by The Sims. 
✨ Observed agents autonomously create and participate in social events.
✨ Found that observation, planning, and reflection are all crucial for authentic agent behavior.

When I see this I’m thinking about the kind of business applications we should build where agents from different departments of a company could talk to each other to adress issues pro-actively.

It sounds so logical to me that we need dedicated agents for specific domain expertise. 

I can’t wait to start building those applications and see how much they will empower us!

Despite the rise of models like ChatGPT, the trusty spreadsheet remains the CxOs favorite. Executives cherish them for the intuitive understanding they provide. 🧠

When I started my career in finance, I was the ""data modeling champion"" of my CFO. I could model financial problems overnight with the right dataset, so we could sit on it the day after and analyze what the best course of action should be. 

I never found this level of ""speed to insights"" since then. But I when deeper into my data modeling craft with Python to build more trustworthy datasets, and automate their retrieval.

While LLMs are revolutionary in generating human-like text, I believe that when it comes to data analysis and calculations, spreadsheets hold their ground, strong.

I envision a way to leverage both worlds and I'm sharing it today in this article:

1️⃣ Jupyter AI: AI-powered assistance for Jupyter Notebooks; I was praying for it, Project Jupyter did it ;) You can now let AI can explain code, fix errors, and generate code in notebooks from natural language prompts.

2️⃣ Python is going to be even more powerful removing the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). It is a game-changer for data processing and analysis. Unlock the full potential of multi-core CPUs, improving performance and aligning with lean data principles.

3️⃣ Polars, the fast data frame library, secures $4 million seed funding. Congrats to the team! Its impressive speed, lightweight design, and ability to handle large datasets effectively were already amazing, I can't wait to see more.

4️⃣ NASA and IBM openly release a Foundation Model for Earth observation data. This open-source geospatial AI model enables tracking land use changes, monitoring natural disasters, and predicting crop yields. I'm sure a lot of applications for the good of our planet can come out of it.

5️⃣ Together.ai extends LLaMA-2 to a 32K context window, enhancing performance and enabling longer context tasks. This breakthrough supports lean data practices, maximizing efficiency and opening new possibilities that can compete with openAI GPTs.

I dive into the details while staying short in the last article 'The Lean Data Journal'; check out the link in the comments to access it.

","If you want to implement GenAI in your organization, you need to learn more about the Theory of Constraints. 

This powerful lean management paradigm helps identify and address the bottlenecks in your process, thus improving overall productivity. Here's how it works:

1. Identify: Find the current constraint (the part of the process that limits the rate at which the goal is achieved).
2. Exploit: Make quick improvements to the constraint's throughput using existing resources (i.e., maximize what you have).
3. Subordinate: Ensure all other activities in the process align with and truly support the constraint's needs.
4. Elevate: If the constraint still exists, consider further actions to eliminate it. Continue actions until the constraint has moved somewhere else. In some cases, capital investment may be required.
5. Repeat: The Five Focusing Steps is a continuous improvement cycle. Once a constraint is resolved, immediately address the next constraint. Never become complacent – aggressively improve the current constraint… and then move on to the next.

I talked about it a few weeks ago in a post but today in this article, I share a real-world encounter with the 'Last Mover' applied to the use of Generative AI.

Hope you like it!

This is the name of the latest article of The Lean Data Journal on the transformative power of AI-driven Business Process Reengineering! 

Somil Gupta shared an HBR article about the subject today, and it instantly resonated with what we are doing with the naas.ai team these days.

That's why I wrote it. 

Did you know that in the 1990s, we witnessed the promise of radical changes in business process engineering through ERP implementation, but so many attempts fell short of expectations?  
Today, AI has the potential to redesign processes and workflows for good, truly BUT we need to stop talking about the technical details. 

In this article, I delve into the impact of AI on business process redesign and how it can revolutionize how we work. 
I'm thrilled to introduce you also to Naas Solutions, our comprehensive range of data products we call Foundation Engines connected to each other.

These blueprint data products can be personalized to fit your unique business needs.

🚀 We are actively implementing these solutions for our own organization (we call this project: ""Drink Your Own Champagne 🍾"") and a select group of clients. If you're eager to embark on this transformative journey, please contact me at jeremy@naas.ai.

Our team recently embarked on a journey exploring our own time management and its influence on our operational efficiency and strategic decision-making. 

We use the Clockify Chrome extension on top of GitHub Issues to track the time allocation for COO and CTO activities, so the first branch of the pipeline was quite accessible. Using our brand new Naas Search and the Naas Pipeline feature, we assembled a Clockify and a Google Sheets template available on Naas awesome-notebooks. We started analyzing our data in a few minutes using pivot tables.

But as a CEO jumping from calls to emails to even coding, I never take the time to log my time in Clockify. We had to adopt a different approach. So we took a Google Calendar template, created a Service Account on GGP (a bit tricky, but once done, you are all set for infinite API calls), filtered down my personal time blockers (time with my son, time to have lunch, time off) and from that got my clean dataset.

The result? 
A pretty neat data product tracking how we invest our time in our product development - Naas v2.

We've shared the details and our key learnings in our latest blog post. If you're keen to dive deeper and see how we transformed time from a constant challenge into a powerful asset, this read is for you!

Would love to get your feedback on this!

Even though they are not as big as the revelations about the aliens we are hearing at the American Congress 👽🤯, here they are:

1️⃣ Stability AI released two new open-source Large Language Models, Stable Beluga 1 & 2, surpassing GPT-4 in certain areas and GPT-3 in most others. This marks a significant victory for the open-source movement. More on the Stability blog.

2️⃣ Stability AI also launched SDXL 1.0, an open text-to-image model that competes with Midjourney. It can generate high-quality images in various artistic styles, including stunning photorealism. 

3️⃣ OpenAI's Head of Trust and Safety, Dave Willner, stepped down to assume an advisory role. This move has raised questions about the future leadership and approach to addressing trust and safety concerns within the AI community. 

4️⃣ Google's Co-Founder, Sergey Brin, returned to lead Project Gemini, an ambitious response to OpenAI's GPT-4. His return signals an exciting phase for Google, but will they catch up? 

5️⃣ Elon Musk renamed Twitter as ""X."" The decision left many perplexed as the iconic bird logo and tweet culture vanished. ""X"" aims to be the ""everything app,"" offering limitless interactivity in audio, video, messaging, payments, and more. 

I believe last week was a pivotal moment in the World. If you like this kind of curated update, give it a 👍 and consider subscribing to our Substack if you are not already.

As I was mentioning in a post earlier this week, we are launching this newsletter on the back of a significant milestone: the transition from Naas.ai v1 to the v2 alpha version. 

As part of this evolution, we have rebranded the historical Naas app to Naas Lab. It was amazing to build v1 on top of Jupyter Lab, we have incorporated features that automate workflow with notebooks, empowering data producers with access to a scheduler, pipelines, asset-sharing capabilities, notifications, webhooks on top of notebooks. 

→ We are now actively working behind the scenes to make all naas services accessible through a single API Gateway to This ensures that our features are seamlessly available outside and inside the Naas ecosystem.

But we always wanted to go further and bridge the gap with data consumers. 

So we added a Google-like search feature on top of our extensive catalog of Notebook templates and MyChatGPT, a ChatGPT-like interface to distribute and interact with data & AI products. 

→ This is our commitment to creating an open alternative to the plugins store being developed by OpenAI.

If you want to follow what we do in more details, start reading the 'The Lean Data Journal'. It is the only place I will use to share product updates and thoughts about this crazy data & AI market. 

Your support mean a lot, I hope you will subscribe :)

In this 3min+ video, I guide you through the basic usage of the Naas platform. We designed this basic usage track in such way that personal or professional users can benefit from it. 

In the video, I demonstrate how to use the platform's features: Naas Search to find the plugin, Lab to customize it and MyChatGPT to consume it. 

These aren't just any plugins - they're templates that utilize GPT-4 language model to tackle specific challenges for different roles.

You'll see how these plugins can be opened either in the chat interface for immediate use or in the Naas platform's development environment for further customization. This allows you to tailor the plugins to your specific needs and preferences.

This use case can serve as a good starting point for implementing AI in an organization. It shows how to create personalized AI assistants for any member of your teams, and get better results than questions & answers from the ""raw"" ChatGPT.

If you're interested in this or have any ideas you'd like to implement, don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help!
Tomorrow I will share the ""Intermediate usage"" track. Stay tuned.

I’m excited to share that I’ve started this video documenting journey about Naas v2 as I told you yesterday. 
In this new version of the platform, we have added 2 new modules: a Google-like search and a ChatGPT-like interface (we call it “MyChatGPT”)

The goal? To bridge the gap between our Python-based scripts inside notebooks and an AI-powered chat interface.

If you are interested in learning more, check out the full video with the link in the comment (maybe on x1.5 because it’s a bit slow). It is a raw, one shot take, about my review of this new type of “plugins” templates that enables you to chat with an social media AI assistant social about LinkedIn profile post.

It fetches your latest posts and presents an extended data frame with various data points and creates an JSON asset URL. 
You can then copy the link and paste it into MyChatGPT by doing /use [URL of the JSON] in the chat input bar...
...and start a conversation!

It’s been quite a journey adding layers to this template, and I’m thrilled to see it taking shape.But the journey doesn’t stop here. We’re generating a JSON file at the end of the process. This opens up new possibilities for data analysis and visualization.

I’m looking forward to more people testing this. It’s a work in progress and I’m learning a lot from this experience. As always, I’m eager to hear your thoughts. Have you used AI for social media analysis? What has been your experience? Let’s discuss! 

PS: if you had a Naas account before v2, you can already play with it. If you don’t, let me know in the comment, we are slowing onboarding users on our limited alpha version.

I learned this from a post by Santiago Valdarrama, you must follow him to stay up to date, I'm a big fan of his content.

The GPT-4 version from June proved to be much less effective in tasks compared to the one from March. 

Speculations point towards continuous updates and the use of smaller, cost-effective models by OpenAI as potential causes.

Such inconsistencies pose serious concerns for those relying on GPT-4. 

But this could be our call to action! I'm keeping an eye on open-source prospects like Llama V2 (I posted about it yesteday, and started playing with it tonight on my local machine). 

Llama V2 and other open source models will offer us more control and transparency, ensuring we aren't just victim but active participants in shaping AI's future.

They just released Llama-v2, with gold nuggets in the paper! The part that caught my attention was ""Dataset Contamination"" in AI Model Training.

First time I'm seeing this level of transparency, and I think it's a very good thing for unlocking business adoption.

It's like having questions in a final exam already given in the study materials.
The data used for model training overlaps with evaluation data, potentially creating an artificial boost in performance.

But at least, now, you know it.

They've categorized data samples into 'clean', 'not clean', 'not dirty', and 'dirty' for the community to understand the impact of contamination on model performance.

Only certain datasets appear to benefit from contamination, with larger models showing more advantages than smaller ones. But it's exciting to see Meta AI strive to share more about accurate and fair models! 🚀

Well done Zuck! Putting your firepower on open source is a bold move.

Here are 3 things on my mind about it:

1/ It's not going to be all about Jupyter Notebooks anymore. We built our case around the fact that Naas notebooks templates are powerful building blocks for data & AI products. The catalog of templates we are building with the community is the foundation, not not the destination.

2/ It's not going to be all about generative AI either. It's about mapping the workflows of teams and organizations that want to make a difference with AI. We are putting together a platform that combines Google-like Search and ChatGPT-like interface, to build data & AI products more intuitively.

3/ It is all going to be about how to build LEAN data & AI experiences. Getting back to the core problems organizations have when it comes to creating awareness (content creation), transforming it into interactions (growth marketing), generating business opportunities (sales conversion), creating a source of truth (operations efficiency), materializing efforts into $$$ (finance management) and understanding better the world around us (open data intelligence)!

This new version of naas.ai is about making data & AI accessible to users with varying technical backgrounds. 

It's about building the universal data & AI platform 🌍🚀

If you are curious about what we are cooking up...let me know in the comment. I can share the link to apply to our limited alpha when it comes out in a few days.

If I were to rewind time and embark on my programming journey again, I wouldn't leap straight into SQL or Python as everybody says. Instead, I would ground myself in the basics: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Why? It's simple. Communication is key.

In the world of data, I see so many people who don't have a basic understanding of how to build a simple website. I can understand why.

We are often so engrossed in how to get the data, that we forget the why, and the importance of presenting our insights in a digestible form.

Mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript gives you the ability to create interactive, engaging, and user-friendly interfaces for data presentation. It bridges the gap between data professionals and those who need our insights.

So, to all the aspiring programmers and data enthusiasts out there, remember: before you dive into the depths of advanced programming, don't overlook the power of the basics. They might just be the secret ingredient to enhancing your data communication skills. 💡

TLDR:
Be lean in your learnings. Focus on efficiency, no waste, and value-adding activities.

PS: If you want a quick start, ask chatGPT to build a website for you, and try to understand the code. I think it's a good way to get started.

This principle, often referred to as the ""theory of constraints,"" is a key concept in business operations. It emphasizes the importance of identifying and addressing the slowest part of any process, as it ultimately determines the overall speed and efficiency of the entire operation. 

In a company, the 'last mover' can be any department, team, or individual that is lagging behind, causing delays or inefficiencies. It could be due to lack of resources, outdated technology, or inefficient processes. But no matter how efficient the other parts of the company are, the overall speed is limited by this 'last mover.'

→ If you want to implement generative AI in your company. You will face this issue. Many people are not ready and scared about it.

Does that resonates with you? 
Happy to chat about it, and curious to know how you think organisation can address that 'last mover' challenge in innovative ways.

OK, that's ""my fault"", I asked for a bubble chart to output the clusters but given that the data was without a clear numerical third dimension, creating a meaningful bubble chart proved to be a complex task.

Then I asked for a scatter plot, and while the messages were saying there was a chart on the screen, nothing was there.

A few minutes later, this error message appeared and I could not trust the process anymore.

This failure is a reminder that data visualization is as much an art as it is a science. It requires creativity, flexibility, and a deep understanding of both the data at hand and the tools available.

And how Liquid Networks can help?,"🔥💦 What are the main AI technical challenges? And how Liquid Networks can help?

Today, I watched a video by Daniela Rus from MIT and I got super interested about her presentation about Liquid Networks and how this new approach can overcome current AI technical challenges.

Main challenges today: 
🔥Data Quality and Quantity: AI systems require large volumes of high-quality data for training. However, acquiring such data can be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming.
🔥Computational and Environmental Costs: AI models, especially deep learning models, are computationally intensive. They require powerful hardware and consume significant energy, which raises environmental concerns.
🔥Black Box Systems: AI systems are often seen as ""black boxes"" because their internal workings are not easily understandable by humans. This lack of transparency can lead to trust issues and makes it hard to identify and correct errors.
..let's not develop Trust and Reasoning :) 

Liquid Networks seems to address these challenges head-on:

💦 They understand tasks better, thanks to their artificial neurons that provide clean and focused attention maps. 🎯
💦 They make AI transparent by transforming the output of neurons into a decision tree, showing us how decisions are made. 🌳
💦 They learn causal relationships, connecting cause and effect in a mathematically consistent way. 🔄

In essence, Liquid Networks present a new, compact, interpretable, and causal model for machine learning that's showing great promise in generalizing under heavy distribution shifts. 

The future of AI looks promising with innovations like these. Let's continue to push the boundaries and unlock AI's full potential! 💪

Self-Service Analytics does not work, and most people who tried it, know it. People cannot play the data producer role and the data consumer role at the same time.

This brings to light a common misconception in the realm of data analytics: the expectation that individuals can seamlessly switch between data production and consumption roles. When organisation do this, they often overlook the complexity of each function.

At Naas, we view this differently. We believe the key to effective analytics isn't about individuals juggling multiple roles, but rather about speeding up the time to insights and fostering efficient collaboration between data producers and consumers.

Data producers are experts in generating and managing data. 
They need tools to make the data speak to an audience, with or without code, the tools they use all have a learning curve.

Data consumers are skilled at interpreting this data to drive decision-making. They don't need tools, they need timely, contextual insights. 

The magic happens when we bridge the gap between these two roles, enabling a smooth, quick transition from data production to consumption. This accelerates the time to insights, leading to quicker, data-driven decisions.

Now, imagine a world where you could just send your Excel spreadsheet to an AI like ChatGPT like what is proposed by their new plugin Code Interpreter. Will that AI plugin ever be as good as the data producer that worked on the data, know where it comes from, can assess its quality and biases, can understand the business story behind it? 

I'm not sure. 
But I can change my mind, and would love to share thoughts.😅

","🫠 Did you see that ChatGPT, the AI rockstar from Microsoft and OpenAI, no longer looks like it will keep growing? 

This could be due to a few factors. It's summer, so a seasonal dip in all internet traffic is expected. Or perhaps, the early-adopters of ChatGPT have peaked. Is it also possible that the novelty of ChatGPT is wearing off and it's not as viral as initially thought?

I believe the technology behind it, the Transformers model, is as revolutionary as the invention of the combustion engine. But like any emerging tech, it's in a crowded market and still has some growing pains, the biggest in my opinion is security concerns + integration in your business workflows (and I don't think the recent launch of code interpreter is going to change that)

For businesses looking to leverage AI, it's crucial to approach it strategically. It's not about chasing the latest trend, but making calculated, incremental steps towards ambitious AI goals. 

AI is a complex field, full of potential for both revenue and cost savings. But it requires a forward-looking strategy and careful decision-making.

Are you using ChatGPT in your business tasks? Do you face any difficulties using it? Do you see this as a temporary dip or a sign of what's to come in the AI landscape? I'd love to hear your thoughts!

🚨Data producers and consumers are not so much job titles, but roles within the data lifecycle. They represent the stages where data is either supplied or utilized.

🔥Take a data engineer, for example. They act as a data consumer when they process ingested third-party data. However, they become a data producer when they develop an ETL pipeline that ends up in a data warehouse for analysts.

🤯 Why is this shift in terminology making waves? It's because it simplifies our understanding of data roles and their responsibilities. It brings back polarity some time you send, sometime you receive. 

☀️By adopting this language, we can focus on how we use data to solve business problems, irrespective of the specific role of the data practitioner.

🌐 Moreover, this terminology is more inclusive. It removes the unnecessary burden of fancy job titles and emphasizes the value each person brings in the data journey.

Don’t forget to follow 🎯 Mark Freeman II  ✅


PS: the image has nothing to do with the subject made me think about transformation, power, the ability to change one's body in order to tap into greater stores of energy, strength and speed. This is what changing the terminology can do!
